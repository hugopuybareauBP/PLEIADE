Curious, she chases the rabbit and falls down a rabbit hole, which leads her into a long tunnel filled with cupboards, book-shelves, maps, and pictures. Alice wonders if she'll fall through the earth but continues to explore, finding a tiny golden key, a bottle labeled \"DRINK ME,\" and a small cake marked \"EAT ME.\" She eats the cake, expecting it to change her size, but remains the same."

The Mouse, who appears to be in charge, calls for everyone's attention and begins telling a story about an archbishop meeting William to offer him the crown. Alice, feeling wet and cold, suggests a race as a solution but no one seems to understand her. The Dodo, who seems confused, proposes a Caucus-race instead. After much thought, the Dodo explains that Alice herself will be the center of the race. Alice hands out comfits as prizes, receiving a thimble in return. The animals eat the comfits, causing chaos and confusion. Meanwhile, Alice ponders the story being told by the Mouse, which seems to her like a nonsensical verse about judgment and death. She hears more footsteps in the distance, hoping it's the Mouse returning to finish his tale."

The Duchess tells Alice that everyone in this world can talk, including babies, and dismisses her intelligence. Alice expresses concern about the baby potentially turning into a pig, but before she can continue the conversation, the Cheshire Cat appears. The Cat suggests that Alice's destination doesn't matter because they are all mad in this world. Alice doubts this but continues on her journey, hoping to meet the March Hare. Along the way, she encounters the Cheshire Cat again, who vanishes and reappears at will."

The procession includes gardeners who are painting roses white instead of red to avoid execution for their mistake. Alice questions the Knave of Hearts about the procession, and he merely bows and smiles. The Queen becomes enraged when she sees Alice and demands her identity. Alice meets the Cheshire Cat, who offers a distraction from the chaotic croquet game being played by various characters. The game is confusing and violent, with players quarrelling and fighting over hedgehogs.

The Cheshire Cat disappears, causing a dispute between the Queen, King, and executioner about whether the cat's head can be cut off without a body. By the time Alice returns to the Cheshire Cat, its head has vanished completely, leaving the King and executioner in search of it while the rest of the party resumes their croquet game."
