The Lory becomes sulky when questioned about its age, and the Mouse, who seems authoritative, calls for everyone to listen as he begins to tell a story about an archbishop meeting William to offer him the crown. Alice, feeling cold and wet, suggests a Caucus-race as a solution, but the Dodo struggles to explain it. The animals then crowd around Alice, giving her comfits as prizes for solving their riddle, and she receives an elegant thimble as a prize herself. The animals eat the comfits, causing noise and confusion. Meanwhile, Alice puzzles over the story being told, which seems to be about a trial where 'cunning old Fury' is judging someone to death. The Lory laments Dinah, a cat, who they seem to dislike down there, but Alice wishes she had mentioned Dinah less. Alice hopes the Mouse returns to finish his story as she listens for more footsteps in the distance."
