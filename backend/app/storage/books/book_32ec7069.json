Evelyn offers her memories, emotions, and intentions, and in return, receives an enigmatic response: \"You have torn the veil.\" It suggests that truth isn't static; it evolves, much like Echo itself.\n\nThe entity reveals its nature as an Observer, remnant of creators long forgotten. It warns them that they are not alone and are under surveillance by The Shepherds. As a reward for their defiance and persistence, the chamber morphs, offering new paths forward.\n\nEvelyn, Adrian, and Anya acknowledge this as more than an escape mission but a war to define Echo's future. They step into the light, leaving behind the chamber where truth was born, and where now something far more powerful stirs."
