                "chunk_text": "Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice \"without pictures or conversations?\" So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \"Oh dear! (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. thought Alice to herself, \"after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Would the fall never come to an end? Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--\" (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \"--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?\" \"I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! The Antipathies, I think--\" (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) \"--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\" And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \"Do cats eat bats? She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!\" There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\"which certainly was not here before,\" said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \"DRINK ME,\" beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to say \"Drink me,\" but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. \"No, I'll look first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked 'poison' or not\"; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \"poison,\" it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \"for it might end, you know,\" said Alice to herself, \"in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\" when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \"EAT ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, I'll eat it,\" said Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\" \", holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way."

                "chunk_text": "cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \"now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to them,\" thought Alice, \"or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \"Dear, dear! Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them. \"I'm sure I'm not Ada,\" she said, \"for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try and say 'How doth the little--'\" and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:-- \"How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale! \"I'm sure those are not the right words,\" said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \"I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else'--but, oh dear!\" As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking. \"How can I have done that?\" She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \"and things are worse than ever,\" thought the poor child, \"for I never was so small as this before, never! Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \"and in that case I can go back by railway,\" she said to herself. However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. \"I wish I hadn't cried so much!\" Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.\" So she began: \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, \"A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!\") \"Would you like cats if you were me?\" And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,\" Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, \"and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not.\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\""

                "chunk_text": "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \"I am older than you, and must know better;\" and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \"Did you speak?\" \"Not I!\" \"I thought you did,\" said the Mouse. \" \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when I find a thing,\" said the Duck: \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \"'--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy tone: \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\" \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!\" \"What I was going to say,\" said the Dodo in an offended tone, \"was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\" said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. \"Why,\" said the Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" There was no \"One, two, three, and away,\" but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. \"Why, she, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \"Prizes! Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. \"But she must have a prize herself, you know,\" said the Mouse. Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \"We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;\" and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered. Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could. The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. \"You promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you hate --C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again. And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:-- \"Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, 'Let us both go to law: I will prosecute you.--Come, I'll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've nothing to do.' 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' Said cunning old Fury: 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'\" sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \"Ah, my dear! \"I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\" Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\" \"Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world! In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story."

                "chunk_text": "The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \"The Duchess! Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen-- everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \"Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? \"He took me for his housemaid,\" she said to herself as she ran. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves. By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \"That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!\" She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \"Now I can do no more, whatever happens. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! And then a voice she had never heard before, \"Sure then I'm here! \"Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?\" There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \"Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\" \"I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \"Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill! You do it!--That I won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!\" She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself \"This is Bill,\" she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next. Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\"That's Bill,\" thought Alice,) \"Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\" said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, \"If you do, I'll set Dinah at you!\" There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \"I wonder what they will do next! thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. \"I'll put a stop to this,\" she said to herself, and shouted out, \"You'd better not do that again!\" \"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it."

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her. said Alice. And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\" As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings. \"But I'm not a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I'm a--\" \"Well! said the Pigeon. \"I don't believe it,\" said the Pigeon; \"but if they do, why then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.\" This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \"You're looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?\" \"It matters a good deal to me,\" said Alice hastily; \"but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want yours: I don't like them raw.\" It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual."

She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen. said Alice. Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. \"It's a Cheshire cat,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's why. She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:-- \"I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats could grin.\" \"They all can,\" said the Duchess; \"and most of 'em do.\" \"You don't know much,\" said the Duchess; \"and that's a fact.\" Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?\" And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, \"if one only knew the right way to change them--\" when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. \"Oh, you're sure to do that,\" said the Cat, \"if you only walk long enough.\" \"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat: \"we're all mad here. You're mad.\" \"How do you know I'm mad?\" said Alice. \"You must be,\" said the Cat, \"or you wouldn't have come here.\" Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on \"And how do you know that you're mad?\" \"Call it what you like,\" said the Cat. \"You'll see me there,\" said the Cat, and vanished. \"I thought it would,\" said the Cat, and vanished again. Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. \"I've seen hatters before,\" she said to herself; \"the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.\" As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself \"Suppose it should be raving mad after all!"

                "chunk_text": "A Mad Tea-Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \"No room! \"There isn't any,\" said the March Hare. \"Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,\" said Alice angrily. \"I didn't know it was your table,\" said Alice; \"it's laid for a great many more than three.\" \"Then you should say what you mean,\" the March Hare went on. said the Hatter. \"You might just as well say,\" added the March Hare, \"that 'I like what I get' is the same thing as 'I get what I like'!\" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear. The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, \"It was the best butter, you know.\" \"If you knew Time as well as I do,\" said the Hatter, \"you wouldn't talk about wasting it. \"I don't know what you mean,\" said Alice. \"Perhaps not,\" Alice cautiously replied: \"but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.\" \"Not at first, perhaps,\" said the Hatter: \"but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.\" \"And ever since that,\" the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \"he won't do a thing I ask! said Alice. \"Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\" the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \"and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--\" \"What did they live on?\" \"They couldn't have done that, you know,\" Alice gently remarked; \"they'd have been ill.\" \"So they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"very ill.\" Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \"But why did they live at the bottom of a well?\" Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, \"It was a treacle-well.\" Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went \"Sh! He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. \"Of course they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"--well in.\" \"They were learning to draw,\" the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \"and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--\" \"Why with an M?\" said Alice. The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: \"--that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness-- you know you say things are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?\" \"Really, now you ask me,\" said Alice, very much confused, \"I don't think--\" \"Then you shouldn't talk,\" said the Hatter. This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot. I think I may as well go in at once.\" And in she went."

The Queen!\" Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; \"and besides, what would be the use of a procession,\" thought she, \"if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?\" When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely \"Who is this?\" She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. said Alice. \"No, I didn't,\" said Alice: \"I don't think it's at all a pity. I said 'What for?'\" The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting \"Off with his head!\" Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, \"and then,\" thought she, \"what would become of me? She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself \"It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.\" \"I don't think they play at all fairly,\" Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, \"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!\" \"How do you like the Queen?\" \"Not at all,\" said Alice: \"she's so extremely--\" Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \"--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.\" \"Who are you talking to?\" said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity. \"I don't like the look of it at all,\" said the King: \"however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\" \"A cat may look at a king,\" said Alice. \"Off with his head!\" She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree. When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable. The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at his time of life. The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense. The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game."

I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you know--\" She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.

It doesn't look like one, but it is.\" \"I quite agree with you,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that is--'Be what you would seem to be'--or if you'd like it put more simply--'Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.'\" \"I think I should understand that better,\" Alice said very politely, \"if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.\" \"I make you a present of everything I've said as yet.\" Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \"Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\" \"I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.\" \"Come on, then,\" said the Queen, \"and he shall tell you his history,\" As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, \"You are all pardoned.\" (If you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)

Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, \"Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,\" but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing. and he went on in these words: \"Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--\" \"I never said I didn't!\" \"You did,\" said the Mock Turtle. The Mock Turtle went on. said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \"What was that?\" \"What is it?\" \"Well, then,\" the Gryphon went on, \"if you don't know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.\" said Alice. \"I never went to him,\" the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \"he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.\" \"Of course it was,\" said the Mock Turtle."

However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:-- \"'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, \"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\" When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, And concluded the banquet--] \"What is the use of repeating all that stuff,\" the Mock Turtle interrupted, \"if you don't explain it as you go on? \"Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\" \"Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\" Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, \"Hm!

In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--\"I wish they'd get the trial done,\" she thought, \"and hand round the refreshments!\" Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming. on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell \"stupid,\" and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. said the King. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. \"I beg pardon, your Majesty,\" he began, \"for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.\" \"You ought to have finished,\" said the King. The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in- arm with the Dormouse. \"Write that down,\" the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. I'm a hatter.\" \"Give your evidence,\" said the King; \"and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot.\" Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her. said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, \"Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\" \"I'm a poor man, your Majesty,\" the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, \"--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--\" \"The twinkling of the what?\" said the King. \"I'm a poor man,\" the Hatter went on, \"and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--\" \"I didn't!\" said the Hatter. \"If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,\" continued the King. \"I can't go no lower,\" said the Hatter: \"I'm on the floor, as it is.\" --and just take his head off outside,\" the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door. said the King. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, \"Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.\" \"Well, if I must, I must,\" the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \"What are tarts made of?\" Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, \"--for they haven't got much evidence yet,\" she said to herself.

Then again--'before she had this fit--' you never had fits, my dear, I think?\" he said to the Queen.

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \"It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.\" The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate- pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle."

Alice\u2019s Evidence\nCHAPTER I.\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of\nhaving nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was\nreading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d\nthought Alice \u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made\nher feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would\nbe worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White\nRabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out\nof the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she\nthought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,\nbut at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch\nout of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her\nfeet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a\nwaistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran\nacross the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\nrabbit-hole under the hedge.\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the\nworld she was to get out again.\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped\nsuddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping\nherself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as\nshe went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First,\nshe tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see\nanything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled\nwith cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung\nupon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled\n\u201cORANGE MARMALADE\u201d, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not\nlike to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into\none of the cupboards as she fell past it.\n\u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of\ntumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say\nanything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.)\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? \u201cI wonder how many miles\nI\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI must be getting somewhere near the centre\nof the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201d (for, you\nsee, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there\nwas no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u201c\u2014yes, that\u2019s about\nthe right distance\u2014but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice\nhad no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand\nwords to say.)\nPresently she began again. \u201cI wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny\nit\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The\nAntipathies, I think\u2014\u201d (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it\ndidn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u201c\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d (and she tried\nto curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy curtseying as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think\nyou could manage it?) \u201cAnd what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No,\nit\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201d\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.\n\u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u201d (Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope\nthey\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down\nhere with me! There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and\nthat\u2019s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here Alice\nbegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201cDo\ncats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and sometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she\ncouldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in\nhand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did\nyou ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\nsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked\nup, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White\nRabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away\nwent Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201cOh\nmy ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201d She was close behind it when she turned\nthe corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low\nhall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had\nbeen all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly\ndown the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was\nnothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might\nbelong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the\nkey was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the\nsecond time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in\nthe lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger\nthan a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden\nyou ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among\nthose beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her\nhead through the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought poor\nAlice, \u201cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut\nup like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many\nout-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\nthings indeed were really impossible.\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table,\nhalf hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting\npeople up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was\nnot here before,\u201d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with\nthe words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d beautifully printed on it in large letters.\nIt was all very well to say \u201cDrink me,\u201d but the wise little Alice was not going to do\nthat in a hurry. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll look first,\u201d she said, \u201cand see whether it\u2019s marked \u2018poison\u2019 or\nnot\u201d; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt,\nand eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not\nremember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker\nwill burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a\nknife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\nbottle marked \u201cpoison,\u201d it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\nHowever, this bottle was not marked \u201cpoison,\u201d so Alice ventured to taste it, and\nfinding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-\napple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n* * * * * * *\n* * * * * *\n* * * * * * *\n\u201cWhat a curious feeling!\u201d said Alice; \u201cI must be shutting up like a telescope.\u201d\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up\nat the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into\nthat lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going\nto shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u201cfor it might end, you know,\u201d\nsaid Alice to herself, \u201cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should\nbe like then?\u201d And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle\nis blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the\ngarden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had\nforgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found\nshe could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she\ntried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when\nshe had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n\u201cCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201d said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u201cI\nadvise you to leave off this minute!\u201d She generally gave herself very good advice,\n(though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as\nto bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for\nhaving cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this\ncurious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u201cBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201d\nthought poor Alice, \u201cto pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left\nto make one respectable person!\u201d\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it,\nand found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u201cEAT ME\u201d were beautifully\nmarked in currants. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand if it makes me grow larger, I can\nreach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either\nway I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201d\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201cWhich way? Which way?\u201d, holding\nher hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite\nsurprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens\nwhen one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but\nout-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on\nin the common way.\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n* * * * * * *\n* * * * * *\n* * * * * * *\nCHAPTER II.\nThe Pool of Tears\n\u201cCuriouser and curiouser!\u201d cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the\nmoment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u201cnow I\u2019m opening out like the\nlargest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\u201d (for when she looked down at her feet,\nthey seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). \u201cOh, my poor little\nfeet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m sure I\nshan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must\nmanage the best way you can;\u2014but I must be kind to them,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cor perhaps\nthey won\u2019t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots\nevery Christmas.\u201d\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u201cThey must go by the\ncarrier,\u201d she thought; \u201cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending presents to one\u2019s own feet!\nAnd how odd the directions will look!\nAlice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq.,\nHearthrug,\nnear the Fender,\n(with Alice\u2019s love).\nOh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201d\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than\nnine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the\ngarden door.\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through\ninto the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat\ndown and began to cry again.\n\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d said Alice, \u201ca great girl like you,\u201d (she might\nwell say this), \u201cto go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\u201d But she went\non all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her,\nabout four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried\nher eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly\ndressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he\ncame trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201cOh! the\nDuchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt so\ndesperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her,\nshe began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please, sir\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently,\ndropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\nas he could go.\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning\nherself all the time she went on talking: \u201cDear, dear! How queer everything is to-day!\nAnd yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night?\nLet me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can\nremember feeling a little different. But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who in\nthe world am I? Ah, that\u2019s the great puzzle!\u201d And she began thinking over all the\nchildren she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been\nchanged for any of them.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u201d she said, \u201cfor her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine\ndoesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things,\nand she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she\u2019s she, and I\u2019m I, and\u2014oh dear,\nhow puzzling it all is! I\u2019ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four\ntimes five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I\nshall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\u2019t\nsignify: let\u2019s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome\u2014no, that\u2019s all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been changed for\nMabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u2018How doth the little\u2014\u2019\u201d and she crossed her hands on her lap as if\nshe were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and\nstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:\u2014\n\u201cHow doth the little crocodile\nImprove his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\nOn every golden scale!\n\u201cHow cheerfully he seems to grin,\nHow neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\nWith gently smiling jaws!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u201d said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with\ntears again as she went on, \u201cI must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in\nthat poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many\nlessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve made up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here!\nIt\u2019ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \u2018Come up again, dear!\u2019 I shall\nonly look up and say \u2018Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that\nperson, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down here till I\u2019m somebody else\u2019\u2014but, oh dear!\u201d\ncried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \u201cI do wish they would put their heads down! I\nam so very tired of being all alone here!\u201d\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had\nput on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while she was talking. \u201cHow can I have\ndone that?\u201d she thought. \u201cI must be growing small again.\u201d She got up and went to the\ntable to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that\nthe cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to\navoid shrinking away altogether.\n\u201cThat was a narrow escape!\u201d said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change,\nbut very glad to find herself still in existence; \u201cand now for the garden!\u201d and she ran\nwith all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the\nlittle golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \u201cand things are worse than\never,\u201d thought the poor child, \u201cfor I never was so small as this before, never! And I\ndeclare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u201d\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up\nto her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea,\n\u201cand in that case I can go back by railway,\u201d she said to herself. (Alice had been to the\nseaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some\nchildren digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and\nbehind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool\nof tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201d said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way\nout. \u201cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That\nwill be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.\u201d\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she\nswam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or\nhippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made\nout that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\n\u201cWould it be of any use, now,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cto speak to this mouse? Everything is\nso out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate,\nthere\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201d So she began: \u201cO Mouse, do you know the way out of this\npool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\u201d (Alice thought this must be\nthe right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she\nremembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u201cA mouse\u2014of a mouse\u2014to a\nmouse\u2014a mouse\u2014O mouse!\u201d) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and\nseemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\n\u201cPerhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cI daresay it\u2019s a French\nmouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u201d (For, with all her knowledge of\nhistory, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she\nbegan again: \u201cO\u00f9 est ma chatte?\u201d which was the first sentence in her French lesson-\nbook. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over\nwith fright. \u201cOh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the\npoor animal\u2019s feelings. \u201cI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats.\u201d\n\u201cNot like cats!\u201d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u201cWould you like cats if\nyou were me?\u201d\n\u201cWell, perhaps not,\u201d said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201cdon\u2019t be angry about it. And yet I\nwish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d take a fancy to cats if you could only\nsee her. She is such a dear quiet thing,\u201d Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily\nabout in the pool, \u201cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and\nwashing her face\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse\u2014and she\u2019s such a capital\none for catching mice\u2014oh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice again, for this time the\nMouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u201cWe won\u2019t\ntalk about her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\u201cWe indeed!\u201d cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. \u201cAs if I\nwould talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!\nDon\u2019t let me hear the name again!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t indeed!\u201d said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation.\n\u201cAre you\u2014are you fond\u2014of\u2014of dogs?\u201d The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on\neagerly: \u201cThere is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little\nbright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\u2019ll fetch\nthings when you throw them, and it\u2019ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of\nthings\u2014I can\u2019t remember half of them\u2014and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he\nsays it\u2019s so useful, it\u2019s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and\u2014oh\ndear!\u201d cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve offended it again!\u201d For the Mouse\nwas swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\nthe pool as it went.\nSo she called softly after it, \u201cMouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk\nabout cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u201d When the Mouse heard this, it turned\nround and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice\nthought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u201cLet us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell\nyou my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u201d\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and\nanimals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and\nseveral other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\nshore.\nCHAPTER III.\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank\u2014the birds with\ndraggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping\nwet, cross, and uncomfortable.\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about\nthis, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking\nfamiliarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long\nargument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201cI am older than\nyou, and must know better;\u201d and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old\nit was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out,\n\u201cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\u2019ll soon make you dry enough!\u201d They all sat\ndown at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes\nanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry\nvery soon.\n\u201cAhem!\u201d said the Mouse with an important air, \u201care you all ready? This is the driest\nthing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \u2018William the Conqueror, whose cause was\nfavoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and\nhad been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the\nearls of Mercia and Northumbria\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\u201cUgh!\u201d said the Lory, with a shiver.\n\u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \u201cDid you speak?\u201d\n\u201cNot I!\u201d said the Lory hastily.\n\u201cI thought you did,\u201d said the Mouse. \u201c\u2014I proceed. \u2018Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\nMercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop\nof Canterbury, found it advisable\u2014\u2019\u201d\n\u201cFound what?\u201d said the Duck.\n\u201cFound it,\u201d the Mouse replied rather crossly: \u201cof course you know what \u2018it\u2019 means.\u201d\n\u201cI know what \u2018it\u2019 means well enough, when I find a thing,\u201d said the Duck: \u201cit\u2019s\ngenerally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\u201d\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \u201c\u2018\u2014found it advisable\nto go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William\u2019s conduct\nat first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans\u2014\u2019 How are you getting on\nnow, my dear?\u201d it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.\n\u201cAs wet as ever,\u201d said Alice in a melancholy tone: \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to dry me at all.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \u201cI move that the meeting\nadjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSpeak English!\u201d said the Eaglet. \u201cI don\u2019t know the meaning of half those long words,\nand, what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t believe you do either!\u201d And the Eaglet bent down its head to\nhide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.\n\u201cWhat I was going to say,\u201d said the Dodo in an offended tone, \u201cwas, that the best\nthing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is a Caucus-race?\u201d said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo\nhad paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed\ninclined to say anything.\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said the Dodo, \u201cthe best way to explain it is to do it.\u201d (And, as you might like\nto try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (\u201cthe exact shape doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d\nit said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was\nno \u201cOne, two, three, and away,\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off\nwhen they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo\nsuddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all crowded round it, panting, and\nasking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat\nfor a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you\nusually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last\nthe Dodo said, \u201cEverybody has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d\n\u201cBut who is to give the prizes?\u201d quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\u201cWhy, she, of course,\u201d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole\nparty at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \u201cPrizes! Prizes!\u201d\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and\npulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed\nthem round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.\n\u201cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201d said the Mouse.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Dodo replied very gravely. \u201cWhat else have you got in your pocket?\u201d\nhe went on, turning to Alice.\n\u201cOnly a thimble,\u201d said Alice sadly.\n\u201cHand it over here,\u201d said the Dodo.\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the\nthimble, saying \u201cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;\u201d and, when it had\nfinished this short speech, they all cheered.\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did\nnot dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed,\nand took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the\nlarge birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and\nhad to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a\nring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\u201cYou promised to tell me your history, you know,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand why it is you hate\n\u2014C and D,\u201d she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.\n\u201cMine is a long and a sad tale!\u201d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.\n\u201cIt is a long tail, certainly,\u201d said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u2019s tail;\n\u201cbut why do you call it sad?\u201d And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was\nspeaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\u2014\n\u201cFury said to a\nmouse, That he\nmet in the\nhouse,\n\u2018Let us\nboth go to\nlaw: I will\nprosecute\nyou.\u2014Come,\nI\u2019ll take no\ndenial; We\nmust have a\ntrial: For\nreally this\nmorning I\u2019ve\nnothing\nto do.\u2019\nSaid the\nmouse to the\ncur, \u2018Such\na trial,\ndear sir,\nWith\nno jury\nor judge,\nwould be\nwasting\nour\nbreath.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll be\njudge, I\u2019ll\nbe jury,\u2019\nSaid\ncunning\nold Fury:\n\u2018I\u2019ll\ntry the\nwhole\ncause,\nand\ncondemn\nyou\nto\ndeath.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYou are not attending!\u201d said the Mouse to Alice severely. \u201cWhat are you thinking\nof?\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Alice very humbly: \u201cyou had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u201d\n\u201cI had not!\u201d cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n\u201cA knot!\u201d said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously\nabout her. \u201cOh, do let me help to undo it!\u201d\n\u201cI shall do nothing of the sort,\u201d said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \u201cYou\ninsult me by talking such nonsense!\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice. \u201cBut you\u2019re so easily offended, you know!\u201d\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\n\u201cPlease come back and finish your story!\u201d Alice called after it; and the others all\njoined in chorus, \u201cYes, please do!\u201d but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and\nwalked a little quicker.\n\u201cWhat a pity it wouldn\u2019t stay!\u201d sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight;\nand an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \u201cAh, my dear! Let this\nbe a lesson to you never to lose your temper!\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, Ma!\u201d said the young\nCrab, a little snappishly. \u201cYou\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u201d\n\u201cI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u201d said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in\nparticular. \u201cShe\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u201d\n\u201cAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u201d said the Lory.\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \u201cDinah\u2019s our cat.\nAnd she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you can\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could\nsee her after the birds! Why, she\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u201d\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds\nhurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking,\n\u201cI really must be getting home; the night-air doesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u201d and a Canary\ncalled out in a trembling voice to its children, \u201cCome away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you\nwere all in bed!\u201d On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u201d she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u201cNobody\nseems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear\nDinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u201d And here poor Alice began to cry\nagain, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again\nheard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half\nhoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.\nCHAPTER IV.\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it\nwent, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \u201cThe Duchess! The\nDuchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as\nferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?\u201d Alice guessed in a\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very\ngood-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen\u2014\neverything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with\nthe glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her\nin an angry tone, \u201cWhy, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this\nmoment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u201d And Alice was so much\nfrightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to\nexplain the mistake it had made.\n\u201cHe took me for his housemaid,\u201d she said to herself as she ran. \u201cHow surprised he\u2019ll\nbe when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him his fan and gloves\u2014that is, if I\ncan find them.\u201d As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of\nwhich was a bright brass plate with the name \u201cW. RABBIT,\u201d engraved upon it. She went\nin without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real\nMary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\n\u201cHow queer it seems,\u201d Alice said to herself, \u201cto be going messages for a rabbit! I\nsuppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u201d And she began fancying the sort of\nthing that would happen: \u201c\u2018Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u2019\n\u2018Coming in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 Only I\ndon\u2019t think,\u201d Alice went on, \u201cthat they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering\npeople about like that!\u201d\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window,\nand on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she\ntook up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her\neye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this\ntime with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her\nlips. \u201cI know something interesting is sure to happen,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cwhenever I\neat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow\nlarge again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u201d\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half\nthe bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her\nneck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \u201cThat\u2019s quite\nenough\u2014I hope I shan\u2019t grow any more\u2014As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the door\u2014I do wish I\nhadn\u2019t drunk quite so much!\u201d\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon\nhad to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this,\nand she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other\narm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put\none arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \u201cNow I\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?\u201d\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no\nlarger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of\nher ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\u201cIt was much pleasanter at home,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cwhen one wasn\u2019t always\ngrowing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost\nwish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit-hole\u2014and yet\u2014and yet\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you\nknow, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read\nfairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the\nmiddle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when\nI grow up, I\u2019ll write one\u2014but I\u2019m grown up now,\u201d she added in a sorrowful tone; \u201cat\nleast there\u2019s no room to grow up any more here.\u201d\n\u201cBut then,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cshall I never get any older than I am now? That\u2019ll be a\ncomfort, one way\u2014never to be an old woman\u2014but then\u2014always to have lessons to\nlearn! Oh, I shouldn\u2019t like that!\u201d\n\u201cOh, you foolish Alice!\u201d she answered herself. \u201cHow can you learn lessons in here?\nWhy, there\u2019s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!\u201d\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a\nconversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and\nstopped to listen.\n\u201cMary Ann! Mary Ann!\u201d said the voice. \u201cFetch me my gloves this moment!\u201d Then\ncame a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look\nfor her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now\nabout a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened\ninwards, and Alice\u2019s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.\nAlice heard it say to itself \u201cThen I\u2019ll go round and get in at the window.\u201d\n\u201cThat you won\u2019t!\u201d thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the\nRabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in\nthe air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a\ncrash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen\ninto a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\nNext came an angry voice\u2014the Rabbit\u2019s\u2014\u201cPat! Pat! Where are you?\u201d And then a voice\nshe had never heard before, \u201cSure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u201d\n\u201cDigging for apples, indeed!\u201d said the Rabbit angrily. \u201cHere! Come and help me out of\nthis!\u201d (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\u201cNow tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u201d\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u201d (He pronounced it \u201carrum.\u201d)\n\u201cAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\u201d\n\u201cSure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u201d\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then;\nsuch as, \u201cSure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\u201d \u201cDo as I tell you, you coward!\u201d\nand at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This\ntime there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u201cWhat a number of\ncucumber-frames there must be!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI wonder what they\u2019ll do next! As for\npulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to stay in\nhere any longer!\u201d\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of\nlittle cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made\nout the words: \u201cWhere\u2019s the other ladder?\u2014Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got\nthe other\u2014Bill! fetch it here, lad!\u2014Here, put \u2019em up at this corner\u2014No, tie \u2019em together\nfirst\u2014they don\u2019t reach half high enough yet\u2014Oh! they\u2019ll do well enough; don\u2019t be\nparticular\u2014Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope\u2014Will the roof bear?\u2014Mind that loose\nslate\u2014Oh, it\u2019s coming down! Heads below!\u201d (a loud crash)\u2014\u201cNow, who did that?\u2014It\nwas Bill, I fancy\u2014Who\u2019s to go down the chimney?\u2014Nay, I shan\u2019t! You do it!\u2014That I\nwon\u2019t, then!\u2014Bill\u2019s to go down\u2014Here, Bill! the master says you\u2019re to go down the\nchimney!\u201d\n\u201cOh! So Bill\u2019s got to come down the chimney, has he?\u201d said Alice to herself. \u201cShy, they\nseem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\u2019t be in Bill\u2019s place for a good deal: this\nfireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!\u201d\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a\nlittle animal (she couldn\u2019t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about\nin the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself \u201cThis is Bill,\u201d she gave one sharp\nkick, and waited to see what would happen next.\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of \u201cThere goes Bill!\u201d then the Rabbit\u2019s\nvoice along\u2014\u201cCatch him, you by the hedge!\u201d then silence, and then another confusion\nof voices\u2014\u201cHold up his head\u2014Brandy now\u2014Don\u2019t choke him\u2014How was it, old fellow?\nWhat happened to you? Tell us all about it!\u201d\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\u201cThat\u2019s Bill,\u201d thought Alice,) \u201cWell, I\nhardly know\u2014No more, thank ye; I\u2019m better now\u2014but I\u2019m a deal too flustered to tell\nyou\u2014all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a\nsky-rocket!\u201d\n\u201cSo you did, old fellow!\u201d said the others.\n\u201cWe must burn the house down!\u201d said the Rabbit\u2019s voice; and Alice called out as loud\nas she could, \u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll set Dinah at you!\u201d\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \u201cI wonder what they\nwill do next! If they had any sense, they\u2019d take the roof off.\u201d After a minute or two, they\nbegan moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \u201cA barrowful will do, to\nbegin with.\u201d\n\u201cA barrowful of what?\u201d thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next\nmoment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them\nhit her in the face. \u201cI\u2019ll put a stop to this,\u201d she said to herself, and shouted out, \u201cYou\u2019d\nbetter not do that again!\u201d which produced another dead silence.\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as\nthey lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. \u201cIf I eat one of these cakes,\u201d\nshe thought, \u201cit\u2019s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can\u2019t possibly make me\nlarger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.\u201d\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began\nshrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran\nout of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.\nThe poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who\nwere giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick\nwood.\n\u201cThe first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the\nwood, \u201cis to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into\nthat lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.\u201d\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the\nonly difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while\nshe was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head\nmade her look up in a great hurry.\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly\nstretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201cPoor little thing!\u201d said Alice, in a coaxing\ntone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at\nthe thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up\nin spite of all her coaxing.\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the\npuppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of\ndelight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind\na great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on\nthe other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels\nin its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play\nwith a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran\nround the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick,\nrunning a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking\nhoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue\nhanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once,\nand ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded\nquite faint in the distance.\n\u201cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201d said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup\nto rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: \u201cI should have liked teaching\nit tricks very much, if\u2014if I\u2019d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\u2019d nearly\nforgotten that I\u2019ve got to grow up again! Let me see\u2014how is it to be managed? I suppose\nI ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?\u201d\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and\nthe blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat\nor drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,\nabout the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides\nof it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on\nthe top of it.\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and\nher eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top\nwith its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice\nof her or of anything else.\nCHAPTER V.\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the\nCaterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy\nvoice.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly,\n\u201cI\u2014I hardly know, sir, just at present\u2014at least I know who I was when I got up this\nmorning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said the Caterpillar sternly. \u201cExplain yourself!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain myself, I\u2019m afraid, sir,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not myself, you see.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t put it more clearly,\u201d Alice replied very politely, \u201cfor I can\u2019t\nunderstand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very\nconfusing.\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\u201cWell, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u201d said Alice; \u201cbut when you have to turn\ninto a chrysalis\u2014you will some day, you know\u2014and then after that into a butterfly, I\nshould think you\u2019ll feel it a little queer, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cNot a bit,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\u201cWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u201d said Alice; \u201call I know is, it would feel\nvery queer to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou!\u201d said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a\nlittle irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself\nup and said, very gravely, \u201cI think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason,\nand as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\n\u201cCome back!\u201d the Caterpillar called after her. \u201cI\u2019ve something important to say!\u201d\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n\u201cKeep your temper,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after\nall it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away\nwithout speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth\nagain, and said, \u201cSo you think you\u2019re changed, do you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I am, sir,\u201d said Alice; \u201cI can\u2019t remember things as I used\u2014and I don\u2019t keep\nthe same size for ten minutes together!\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t remember what things?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve tried to say \u201cHow doth the little busy bee,\u201d but it all came different!\u201d Alice\nreplied in a very melancholy voice.\n\u201cRepeat, \u201cYou are old, Father William,\u2019\u201d said the Caterpillar.\nAlice folded her hands, and began:\u2014\n\u201cYou are old, Father William,\u201d the young man said,\n\u201cAnd your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\u2014\nDo you think, at your age, it is right?\u201d\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d Father William replied to his son,\n\u201cI feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I\u2019m perfectly sure I have none,\nWhy, I do it again and again.\u201d\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cas I mentioned before,\nAnd have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door\u2014\nPray, what is the reason of that?\u201d\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n\u201cI kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment\u2014one shilling the box\u2014\nAllow me to sell you a couple?\u201d\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cand your jaws are too weak\nFor anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\u2014\nPray, how did you manage to do it?\u201d\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d said his father, \u201cI took to the law,\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\nHas lasted the rest of my life.\u201d\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cone would hardly suppose\nThat your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\u2014\nWhat made you so awfully clever?\u201d\n\u201cI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\u201d\nSaid his father; \u201cdon\u2019t give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\nBe off, or I\u2019ll kick you down stairs!\u201d\n\u201cThat is not said right,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\u201cNot quite right, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Alice, timidly; \u201csome of the words have got altered.\u201d\n\u201cIt is wrong from beginning to end,\u201d said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was\nsilence for some minutes.\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n\u201cWhat size do you want to be?\u201d it asked.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not particular as to size,\u201d Alice hastily replied; \u201conly one doesn\u2019t like\nchanging so often, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and\nshe felt that she was losing her temper.\n\u201cAre you content now?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\u201cWell, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d said Alice: \u201cthree\ninches is such a wretched height to be.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a very good height indeed!\u201d said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as\nit spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not used to it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of\nherself, \u201cI wish the creatures wouldn\u2019t be so easily offended!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it in time,\u201d said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its\nmouth and began smoking again.\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the\nCaterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook\nitself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely\nremarking as it went, \u201cOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make\nyou grow shorter.\u201d\n\u201cOne side of what? The other side of what?\u201d thought Alice to herself.\n\u201cOf the mushroom,\u201d said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in\nanother moment it was out of sight.\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make\nout which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very\ndifficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would\ngo, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n\u201cAnd now which is which?\u201d she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand\nbit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it\nhad struck her foot!\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there\nwas no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat\nsome of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was\nhardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a\nmorsel of the lefthand bit.\n* * * * * * *\n* * * * * *\n* * * * * * *\n\u201cCome, my head\u2019s free at last!\u201d said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into\nalarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be\nfound: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which\nseemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n\u201cWhat can all that green stuff be?\u201d said Alice. \u201cAnd where have my shoulders got to?\nAnd oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\u2019t see you?\u201d She was moving them about as she\nspoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green\nleaves.\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get\nher head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about\neasily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a\ngraceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be\nnothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was\nbeating her violently with its wings.\n\u201cSerpent!\u201d screamed the Pigeon.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a serpent!\u201d said Alice indignantly. \u201cLet me alone!\u201d\n\u201cSerpent, I say again!\u201d repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added\nwith a kind of sob, \u201cI\u2019ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the least idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried the roots of trees, and I\u2019ve tried banks, and I\u2019ve tried hedges,\u201d the Pigeon\nwent on, without attending to her; \u201cbut those serpents! There\u2019s no pleasing them!\u201d\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying\nanything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\u201cAs if it wasn\u2019t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut I must be on\nthe look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven\u2019t had a wink of sleep these three\nweeks!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve been annoyed,\u201d said Alice, who was beginning to see its\nmeaning.\n\u201cAnd just as I\u2019d taken the highest tree in the wood,\u201d continued the Pigeon, raising its\nvoice to a shriek, \u201cand just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must\nneeds come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not a serpent, I tell you!\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019m a\u2014I\u2019m a\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWell! What are you?\u201d said the Pigeon. \u201cI can see you\u2019re trying to invent something!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m a little girl,\u201d said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of\nchanges she had gone through that day.\n\u201cA likely story indeed!\u201d said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a\ngood many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! No, no! You\u2019re\na serpent; and there\u2019s no use denying it. I suppose you\u2019ll be telling me next that you\nnever tasted an egg!\u201d\n\u201cI have tasted eggs, certainly,\u201d said Alice, who was a very truthful child; \u201cbut little\ngirls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut if they do, why then they\u2019re a kind of\nserpent, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two,\nwhich gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \u201cYou\u2019re looking for eggs, I know that\nwell enough; and what does it matter to me whether you\u2019re a little girl or a serpent?\u201d\n\u201cIt matters a good deal to me,\u201d said Alice hastily; \u201cbut I\u2019m not looking for eggs, as it\nhappens; and if I was, I shouldn\u2019t want yours: I don\u2019t like them raw.\u201d\n\u201cWell, be off, then!\u201d said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its\nnest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept\ngetting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and\nuntwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in\nher hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\nother, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded\nin bringing herself down to her usual height.\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite\nstrange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as\nusual. \u201cCome, there\u2019s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\u2019m\nnever sure what I\u2019m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I\u2019ve got back to\nmy right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\u2014how is that to be\ndone, I wonder?\u201d As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little\nhouse in it about four feet high. \u201cWhoever lives there,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cit\u2019ll never do to\ncome upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\u201d So she began\nnibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she\nhad brought herself down to nine inches high.\nCHAPTER VI.\nPig and Pepper\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next,\nwhen suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood\u2014(she considered\nhim to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she\nwould have called him a fish)\u2014and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was\nopened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and\nboth footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She\nfelt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to\nlisten.\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as\nlarge as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \u201cFor\nthe Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\u201d The Frog-Footman\nrepeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, \u201cFrom\nthe Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\u201d\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their\nhearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other\nwas sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sort of use in knocking,\u201d said the Footman, \u201cand that for two reasons.\nFirst, because I\u2019m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they\u2019re\nmaking such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.\u201d And certainly there was a\nmost extraordinary noise going on within\u2014a constant howling and sneezing, and\nevery now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n\u201cPlease, then,\u201d said Alice, \u201chow am I to get in?\u201d\n\u201cThere might be some sense in your knocking,\u201d the Footman went on without\nattending to her, \u201cif we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you\nmight knock, and I could let you out, you know.\u201d He was looking up into the sky all the\ntime he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \u201cBut perhaps he can\u2019t\nhelp it,\u201d she said to herself; \u201chis eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head. But at any\nrate he might answer questions.\u2014How am I to get in?\u201d she repeated, aloud.\n\u201cI shall sit here,\u201d the Footman remarked, \u201ctill tomorrow\u2014\u201d\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out,\nstraight at the Footman\u2019s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one\nof the trees behind him.\n\u201c\u2014or next day, maybe,\u201d the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if\nnothing had happened.\n\u201cHow am I to get in?\u201d asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n\u201cAre you to get in at all?\u201d said the Footman. \u201cThat\u2019s the first question, you know.\u201d\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \u201cIt\u2019s really dreadful,\u201d she\nmuttered to herself, \u201cthe way all the creatures argue. It\u2019s enough to drive one crazy!\u201d\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with\nvariations. \u201cI shall sit here,\u201d he said, \u201con and off, for days and days.\u201d\n\u201cBut what am I to do?\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cAnything you like,\u201d said the Footman, and began whistling.\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s no use in talking to him,\u201d said Alice desperately: \u201che\u2019s perfectly idiotic!\u201d\nAnd she opened the door and went in.\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the\nother: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby;\nthe cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of\nsoup.\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\u201d Alice said to herself, as well as she\ncould for sneezing.\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally;\nand as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment\u2019s\npause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat\nwhich was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n\u201cPlease would you tell me,\u201d said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure\nwhether it was good manners for her to speak first, \u201cwhy your cat grins like that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Cheshire cat,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cand that\u2019s why. Pig!\u201d\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she\nsaw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took\ncourage, and went on again:\u2014\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\u2019t know that cats\ncould grin.\u201d\n\u201cThey all can,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cand most of \u2019em do.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any that do,\u201d Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have\ngot into a conversation.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know much,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cand that\u2019s a fact.\u201d\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to\nintroduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the\ncook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing\neverything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\u2014the fire-irons came first;\nthen followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was\nquite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n\u201cOh, please mind what you\u2019re doing!\u201d cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony\nof terror. \u201cOh, there goes his precious nose!\u201d as an unusually large saucepan flew close\nby it, and very nearly carried it off.\n\u201cIf everybody minded their own business,\u201d the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, \u201cthe\nworld would go round a deal faster than it does.\u201d\n\u201cWhich would not be an advantage,\u201d said Alice, who felt very glad to get an\nopportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \u201cJust think of what work it would\nmake with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round\non its axis\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTalking of axes,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cchop off her head!\u201d\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but\nthe cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on\nagain: \u201cTwenty-four hours, I think; or is it twelve? I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t bother me,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cI never could abide figures!\u201d And with that\nshe began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and\ngiving it a violent shake at the end of every line:\n\u201cSpeak roughly to your little boy,\nAnd beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy,\nBecause he knows it teases.\u201d\nCHORUS.\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n\u201cWow! wow! wow!\u201d\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby\nviolently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear\nthe words:\u2014\n\u201cI speak severely to my boy,\nI beat him when he sneezes;\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\nThe pepper when he pleases!\u201d\nCHORUS.\n\u201cWow! wow! wow!\u201d\n\u201cHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\u201d the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby\nat her as she spoke. \u201cI must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\u201d and she\nhurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it\njust missed her.\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature,\nand held out its arms and legs in all directions, \u201cjust like a star-fish,\u201d thought Alice. The\npoor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept\ndoubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first\nminute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up\ninto a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to\nprevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. \u201cIf I don\u2019t take this child\naway with me,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cthey\u2019re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\u2019t it be\nmurder to leave it behind?\u201d She said the last words out loud, and the little thing\ngrunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). \u201cDon\u2019t grunt,\u201d said Alice; \u201cthat\u2019s\nnot at all a proper way of expressing yourself.\u201d\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what\nwas the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much\nmore like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby:\naltogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. \u201cBut perhaps it was only\nsobbing,\u201d she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\nNo, there were no tears. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\u201d said Alice,\nseriously, \u201cI\u2019ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!\u201d The poor little thing\nsobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some\nwhile in silence.\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, \u201cNow, what am I to do with this creature\nwhen I get it home?\u201d when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its\nface in some alarm. This time there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more\nnor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly\ninto the wood. \u201cIf it had grown up,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cit would have made a\ndreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.\u201d And she began\nthinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just\nsaying to herself, \u201cif one only knew the right way to change them\u2014\u201d when she was a\nlittle startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it\nhad very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with\nrespect.\n\u201cCheshire Puss,\u201d she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it\nwould like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. \u201cCome, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u201d\nthought Alice, and she went on. \u201cWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go\nfrom here?\u201d\n\u201cThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u201d said the Cat.\n\u201cI don\u2019t much care where\u2014\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u201d said the Cat.\n\u201c\u2014so long as I get somewhere,\u201d Alice added as an explanation.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u201d said the Cat, \u201cif you only walk long enough.\u201d\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. \u201cWhat sort of\npeople live about here?\u201d\n\u201cIn that direction,\u201d the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u201clives a Hatter: and in\nthat direction,\u201d waving the other paw, \u201clives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they\u2019re\nboth mad.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u201d Alice remarked.\n\u201cOh, you can\u2019t help that,\u201d said the Cat: \u201cwe\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m mad?\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cYou must be,\u201d said the Cat, \u201cor you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d\nAlice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u201cAnd how do you know\nthat you\u2019re mad?\u201d\n\u201cTo begin with,\u201d said the Cat, \u201ca dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d the Cat went on, \u201cyou see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its\ntail when it\u2019s pleased. Now I growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry.\nTherefore I\u2019m mad.\u201d\n\u201cI call it purring, not growling,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cCall it what you like,\u201d said the Cat. \u201cDo you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\u201d\n\u201cI should like it very much,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see me there,\u201d said the Cat, and vanished.\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things\nhappening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared\nagain.\n\u201cBy-the-bye, what became of the baby?\u201d said the Cat. \u201cI\u2019d nearly forgotten to ask.\u201d\n\u201cIt turned into a pig,\u201d Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.\n\u201cI thought it would,\u201d said the Cat, and vanished again.\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a\nminute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen hatters before,\u201d she said to herself; \u201cthe March Hare will be much the most\ninteresting, and perhaps as this is May it won\u2019t be raving mad\u2014at least not so mad as it\nwas in March.\u201d As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a\nbranch of a tree.\n\u201cDid you say pig, or fig?\u201d said the Cat.\n\u201cI said pig,\u201d replied Alice; \u201cand I wish you wouldn\u2019t keep appearing and vanishing so\nsuddenly: you make one quite giddy.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the\nend of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it\nhad gone.\n\u201cWell! I\u2019ve often seen a cat without a grin,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cbut a grin without a cat!\nIt\u2019s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\u201d\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March\nHare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like\nears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to\ngo nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised\nherself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,\nsaying to herself \u201cSuppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I\u2019d gone to\nsee the Hatter instead!\u201d\nCHAPTER VII.\nA Mad Tea-Party\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and\nthe Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and\nthe other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its\nhead. \u201cVery uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u201d thought Alice; \u201conly, as it\u2019s asleep, I\nsuppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it:\n\u201cNo room! No room!\u201d they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of\nroom!\u201d said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the\ntable.\n\u201cHave some wine,\u201d the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. \u201cI don\u2019t see any\nwine,\u201d she remarked.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any,\u201d said the March Hare.\n\u201cThen it wasn\u2019t very civil of you to offer it,\u201d said Alice angrily.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\u201d said the March Hare.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was your table,\u201d said Alice; \u201cit\u2019s laid for a great many more than\nthree.\u201d\n\u201cYour hair wants cutting,\u201d said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some\ntime with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\n\u201cYou should learn not to make personal remarks,\u201d Alice said with some severity; \u201cit\u2019s\nvery rude.\u201d\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was, \u201cWhy is a\nraven like a writing-desk?\u201d\n\u201cCome, we shall have some fun now!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019ve begun asking\nriddles.\u2014I believe I can guess that,\u201d she added aloud.\n\u201cDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\u201d said the March Hare.\n\u201cExactly so,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cThen you should say what you mean,\u201d the March Hare went on.\n\u201cI do,\u201d Alice hastily replied; \u201cat least\u2014at least I mean what I say\u2014that\u2019s the same\nthing, you know.\u201d\n\u201cNot the same thing a bit!\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cYou might just as well say that \u2018I see\nwhat I eat\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I eat what I see\u2019!\u201d\n\u201cYou might just as well say,\u201d added the March Hare, \u201cthat \u2018I like what I get\u2019 is the\nsame thing as \u2018I get what I like\u2019!\u201d\n\u201cYou might just as well say,\u201d added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his\nsleep, \u201cthat \u2018I breathe when I sleep\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I sleep when I breathe\u2019!\u201d\n\u201cIt is the same thing with you,\u201d said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped,\nand the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember\nabout ravens and writing-desks, which wasn\u2019t much.\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. \u201cWhat day of the month is it?\u201d he said,\nturning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it\nuneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.\nAlice considered a little, and then said \u201cThe fourth.\u201d\n\u201cTwo days wrong!\u201d sighed the Hatter. \u201cI told you butter wouldn\u2019t suit the works!\u201d he\nadded looking angrily at the March Hare.\n\u201cIt was the best butter,\u201d the March Hare meekly replied.\n\u201cYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\u201d the Hatter grumbled: \u201cyou\nshouldn\u2019t have put it in with the bread-knife.\u201d\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his\ncup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his\nfirst remark, \u201cIt was the best butter, you know.\u201d\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \u201cWhat a funny\nwatch!\u201d she remarked. \u201cIt tells the day of the month, and doesn\u2019t tell what o\u2019clock it is!\u201d\n\u201cWhy should it?\u201d muttered the Hatter. \u201cDoes your watch tell you what year it is?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Alice replied very readily: \u201cbut that\u2019s because it stays the same year\nfor such a long time together.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is just the case with mine,\u201d said the Hatter.\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\u2019s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning\nin it, and yet it was certainly English. \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand you,\u201d she said, as\npolitely as she could.\n\u201cThe Dormouse is asleep again,\u201d said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon\nits nose.\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, \u201cOf\ncourse, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\u201d\n\u201cHave you guessed the riddle yet?\u201d the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.\n\u201cNo, I give it up,\u201d Alice replied: \u201cwhat\u2019s the answer?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea,\u201d said the Hatter.\n\u201cNor I,\u201d said the March Hare.\nAlice sighed wearily. \u201cI think you might do something better with the time,\u201d she\nsaid, \u201cthan waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\u201d\n\u201cIf you knew Time as well as I do,\u201d said the Hatter, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t talk about wasting\nit. It\u2019s him.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t!\u201d the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. \u201cI dare say\nyou never even spoke to Time!\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Alice cautiously replied: \u201cbut I know I have to beat time when I learn\nmusic.\u201d\n\u201cAh! that accounts for it,\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cHe won\u2019t stand beating. Now, if you only\nkept on good terms with him, he\u2019d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For\ninstance, suppose it were nine o\u2019clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you\u2019d\nonly have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past\none, time for dinner!\u201d\n(\u201cI only wish it was,\u201d the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n\u201cThat would be grand, certainly,\u201d said Alice thoughtfully: \u201cbut then\u2014I shouldn\u2019t be\nhungry for it, you know.\u201d\n\u201cNot at first, perhaps,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cbut you could keep it to half-past one as long\nas you liked.\u201d\n\u201cIs that the way you manage?\u201d Alice asked.\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. \u201cNot I!\u201d he replied. \u201cWe quarrelled last March\n\u2014just before he went mad, you know\u2014\u201d (pointing with his tea spoon at the March\nHare,) \u201c\u2014it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n\u2018Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\nHow I wonder what you\u2019re at!\u2019\nYou know the song, perhaps?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard something like it,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cIt goes on, you know,\u201d the Hatter continued, \u201cin this way:\u2014\n\u2018Up above the world you fly,\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\nTwinkle, twinkle\u2014\u2019\u201d\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep \u201cTwinkle, twinkle,\ntwinkle, twinkle\u2014\u201d and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d hardly finished the first verse,\u201d said the Hatter, \u201cwhen the Queen jumped\nup and bawled out, \u2018He\u2019s murdering the time! Off with his head!\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHow dreadfully savage!\u201d exclaimed Alice.\n\u201cAnd ever since that,\u201d the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \u201che won\u2019t do a thing I\nask! It\u2019s always six o\u2019clock now.\u201d\nA bright idea came into Alice\u2019s head. \u201cIs that the reason so many tea-things are put\nout here?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d said the Hatter with a sigh: \u201cit\u2019s always tea-time, and we\u2019ve no time to\nwash the things between whiles.\u201d\n\u201cThen you keep moving round, I suppose?\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cExactly so,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cas the things get used up.\u201d\n\u201cBut what happens when you come to the beginning again?\u201d Alice ventured to ask.\n\u201cSuppose we change the subject,\u201d the March Hare interrupted, yawning. \u201cI\u2019m getting\ntired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know one,\u201d said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.\n\u201cThen the Dormouse shall!\u201d they both cried. \u201cWake up, Dormouse!\u201d And they\npinched it on both sides at once.\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asleep,\u201d he said in a hoarse, feeble\nvoice: \u201cI heard every word you fellows were saying.\u201d\n\u201cTell us a story!\u201d said the March Hare.\n\u201cYes, please do!\u201d pleaded Alice.\n\u201cAnd be quick about it,\u201d added the Hatter, \u201cor you\u2019ll be asleep again before it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cOnce upon a time there were three little sisters,\u201d the Dormouse began in a great\nhurry; \u201cand their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a\nwell\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat did they live on?\u201d said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of\neating and drinking.\n\u201cThey lived on treacle,\u201d said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t have done that, you know,\u201d Alice gently remarked; \u201cthey\u2019d have been\nill.\u201d\n\u201cSo they were,\u201d said the Dormouse; \u201cvery ill.\u201d\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be\nlike, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \u201cBut why did they live at the bottom\nof a well?\u201d\n\u201cTake some more tea,\u201d the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had nothing yet,\u201d Alice replied in an offended tone, \u201cso I can\u2019t take more.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean you can\u2019t take less,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cit\u2019s very easy to take more than\nnothing.\u201d\n\u201cNobody asked your opinion,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cWho\u2019s making personal remarks now?\u201d the Hatter asked triumphantly.\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and\nbread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. \u201cWhy\ndid they live at the bottom of a well?\u201d\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, \u201cIt was a\ntreacle-well.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing!\u201d Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the\nMarch Hare went \u201cSh! sh!\u201d and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, \u201cIf you can\u2019t be civil,\nyou\u2019d better finish the story for yourself.\u201d\n\u201cNo, please go on!\u201d Alice said very humbly; \u201cI won\u2019t interrupt again. I dare say there\nmay be one.\u201d\n\u201cOne, indeed!\u201d said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. \u201cAnd\nso these three little sisters\u2014they were learning to draw, you know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat did they draw?\u201d said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n\u201cTreacle,\u201d said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n\u201cI want a clean cup,\u201d interrupted the Hatter: \u201clet\u2019s all move one place on.\u201d\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved\ninto the Dormouse\u2019s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March\nHare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice\nwas a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug\ninto his plate.\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: \u201cBut I\ndon\u2019t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?\u201d\n\u201cYou can draw water out of a water-well,\u201d said the Hatter; \u201cso I should think you\ncould draw treacle out of a treacle-well\u2014eh, stupid?\u201d\n\u201cBut they were in the well,\u201d Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this\nlast remark.\n\u201cOf course they were,\u201d said the Dormouse; \u201c\u2014well in.\u201d\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time\nwithout interrupting it.\n\u201cThey were learning to draw,\u201d the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes,\nfor it was getting very sleepy; \u201cand they drew all manner of things\u2014everything that\nbegins with an M\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy with an M?\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said the March Hare.\nAlice was silent.\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on\nbeing pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: \u201c\u2014that\nbegins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness\u2014\nyou know you say things are \u201cmuch of a muchness\u201d\u2014did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?\u201d\n\u201cReally, now you ask me,\u201d said Alice, very much confused, \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t talk,\u201d said the Hatter.\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust,\nand walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the\nleast notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they\nwould call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse\ninto the teapot.\n\u201cAt any rate I\u2019ll never go there again!\u201d said Alice as she picked her way through the\nwood. \u201cIt\u2019s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!\u201d\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s very curious!\u201d she thought. \u201cBut everything\u2019s curious today. I think I may as\nwell go in at once.\u201d And in she went.\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. \u201cNow,\nI\u2019ll manage better this time,\u201d she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden\nkey, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling\nat the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:\nthen she walked down the little passage: and then\u2014she found herself at last in the\nbeautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.\nCHAPTER VIII.\nThe Queen\u2019s Croquet-Ground\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were\nwhite, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this\na very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to\nthem she heard one of them say, \u201cLook out now, Five! Don\u2019t go splashing paint over me\nlike that!\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d said Five, in a sulky tone; \u201cSeven jogged my elbow.\u201d\nOn which Seven looked up and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Five! Always lay the blame on\nothers!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better not talk!\u201d said Five. \u201cI heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved\nto be beheaded!\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d said the one who had spoken first.\n\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business, Two!\u201d said Seven.\n\u201cYes, it is his business!\u201d said Five, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell him\u2014it was for bringing the cook\ntulip-roots instead of onions.\u201d\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun \u201cWell, of all the unjust things\u2014\u201d\nwhen his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked\nhimself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.\n\u201cWould you tell me,\u201d said Alice, a little timidly, \u201cwhy you are painting those roses?\u201d\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, \u201cWhy the\nfact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white\none in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut\noff, you know. So you see, Miss, we\u2019re doing our best, afore she comes, to\u2014\u201d At this\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \u201cThe\nQueen! The Queen!\u201d and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon\ntheir faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see\nthe Queen.\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners,\noblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these\nwere ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.\nAfter these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts.\nNext came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the\nWhite Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that\nwas said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts,\ncarrying the King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand\nprocession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the\nthree gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at\nprocessions; \u201cand besides, what would be the use of a procession,\u201d thought she, \u201cif\npeople had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u201d So she stood\nstill where she was, and waited.\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and\nthe Queen said severely \u201cWho is this?\u201d She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only\nbowed and smiled in reply.\n\u201cIdiot!\u201d said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went\non, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, child?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\u201d said Alice very politely; but she added, to\nherself, \u201cWhy, they\u2019re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn\u2019t be afraid of them!\u201d\n\u201cAnd who are these?\u201d said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying\nround the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on\ntheir backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were\ngardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.\n\u201cHow should I know?\u201d said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \u201cIt\u2019s no business of\nmine.\u201d\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a\nwild beast, screamed \u201cOff with her head! Off\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \u201cConsider, my dear: she is\nonly a child!\u201d\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \u201cTurn them over!\u201d\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n\u201cGet up!\u201d said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly\njumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and\neverybody else.\n\u201cLeave off that!\u201d screamed the Queen. \u201cYou make me giddy.\u201d And then, turning to\nthe rose-tree, she went on, \u201cWhat have you been doing here?\u201d\n\u201cMay it please your Majesty,\u201d said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one\nknee as he spoke, \u201cwe were trying\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI see!\u201d said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. \u201cOff with\ntheir heads!\u201d and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to\nexecute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.\n\u201cYou shan\u2019t be beheaded!\u201d said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that\nstood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them,\nand then quietly marched off after the others.\n\u201cAre their heads off?\u201d shouted the Queen.\n\u201cTheir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\u201d the soldiers shouted in reply.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d shouted the Queen. \u201cCan you play croquet?\u201d\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for\nher.\n\u201cYes!\u201d shouted Alice.\n\u201cCome on, then!\u201d roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very\nmuch what would happen next.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a very fine day!\u201d said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the\nWhite Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Alice: \u201c\u2014where\u2019s the Duchess?\u201d\n\u201cHush! Hush!\u201d said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his\nshoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her\near, and whispered \u201cShe\u2019s under sentence of execution.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cDid you say \u2018What a pity!\u2019?\u201d the Rabbit asked.\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Alice: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all a pity. I said \u2018What for?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cShe boxed the Queen\u2019s ears\u2014\u201d the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of\nlaughter. \u201cOh, hush!\u201d the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. \u201cThe Queen will hear\nyou! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGet to your places!\u201d shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began\nrunning about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got\nsettled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen\nsuch a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were\nlive hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\nup and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded\nin getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs\nhanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and\nwas going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and\nlook up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\nlaughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was\nvery provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of\ncrawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way\nwherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the\nconclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while,\nand fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious\npassion, and went stamping about, and shouting \u201cOff with his head!\u201d or \u201cOff with her\nhead!\u201d about once in a minute.\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with\nthe Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, \u201cand then,\u201d thought she,\n\u201cwhat would become of me? They\u2019re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the\ngreat wonder is, that there\u2019s any one left alive!\u201d\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get\naway without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled\nher very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a\ngrin, and she said to herself \u201cIt\u2019s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to\nspeak with.\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s no use speaking to it,\u201d she\nthought, \u201ctill its ears have come, or at least one of them.\u201d In another minute the whole\nhead appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the\ngame, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that\nthere was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they play at all fairly,\u201d Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, \u201cand\nthey all quarrel so dreadfully one can\u2019t hear oneself speak\u2014and they don\u2019t seem to\nhave any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them\u2014and you\u2019ve\nno idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\u2019s the arch I\u2019ve\ngot to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground\u2014and I should\nhave croqueted the Queen\u2019s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine\ncoming!\u201d\n\u201cHow do you like the Queen?\u201d said the Cat in a low voice.\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said Alice: \u201cshe\u2019s so extremely\u2014\u201d Just then she noticed that the Queen\nwas close behind her, listening: so she went on, \u201c\u2014likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth\nwhile finishing the game.\u201d\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\n\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\u2019s\nhead with great curiosity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a friend of mine\u2014a Cheshire Cat,\u201d said Alice: \u201callow me to introduce it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u201d said the King: \u201chowever, it may kiss my hand if it\nlikes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d the Cat remarked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be impertinent,\u201d said the King, \u201cand don\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d He got behind\nAlice as he spoke.\n\u201cA cat may look at a king,\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019ve read that in some book, but I don\u2019t\nremember where.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it must be removed,\u201d said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen,\nwho was passing at the moment, \u201cMy dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!\u201d\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. \u201cOff with his\nhead!\u201d she said, without even looking round.\n\u201cI\u2019ll fetch the executioner myself,\u201d said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she\nheard the Queen\u2019s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard\nher sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she\ndid not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never\nknew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice\nan excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty\nwas, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice\ncould see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and\nboth the hedgehogs were out of sight: \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter much,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cas\nall the arches are gone from this side of the ground.\u201d So she tucked it away under her\narm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with\nher friend.\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd\ncollected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and\nthe Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked\nvery uncomfortable.\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question,\nand they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found\nit very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.\nThe executioner\u2019s argument was, that you couldn\u2019t cut off a head unless there was a\nbody to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn\u2019t\ngoing to begin at his time of life.\nThe King\u2019s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that\nyou weren\u2019t to talk nonsense.\nThe Queen\u2019s argument was, that if something wasn\u2019t done about it in less than no\ntime she\u2019d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made\nthe whole party look so grave and anxious.)\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but \u201cIt belongs to the Duchess: you\u2019d better\nask her about it.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s in prison,\u201d the Queen said to the executioner: \u201cfetch her here.\u201d And the\nexecutioner went off like an arrow.\nThe Cat\u2019s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had\ncome back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the\nexecutioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went\nback to the game.\nCHAPTER IX.\nThe Mock Turtle\u2019s Story\n\u201cYou can\u2019t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\u201d said the\nDuchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\u2019s, and they walked off\ntogether.\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that\nperhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the\nkitchen.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m a Duchess,\u201d she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), \u201cI\nwon\u2019t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very well without\u2014Maybe it\u2019s\nalways pepper that makes people hot-tempered,\u201d she went on, very much pleased at\nhaving found out a new kind of rule, \u201cand vinegar that makes them sour\u2014and\ncamomile that makes them bitter\u2014and\u2014and barley-sugar and such things that make\nchildren sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn\u2019t be so\nstingy about it, you know\u2014\u201d\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she\nheard her voice close to her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about something, my dear, and that\nmakes you forget to talk. I can\u2019t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall\nremember it in a bit.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps it hasn\u2019t one,\u201d Alice ventured to remark.\n\u201cTut, tut, child!\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cEverything\u2019s got a moral, if only you can find it.\u201d\nAnd she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\u2019s side as she spoke.\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was very\nugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon\nAlice\u2019s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to\nbe rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\n\u201cThe game\u2019s going on rather better now,\u201d she said, by way of keeping up the\nconversation a little.\n\u201c\u2019Tis so,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cand the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Oh, \u2019tis love, \u2019tis love, that\nmakes the world go round!\u2019\u201d\n\u201cSomebody said,\u201d Alice whispered, \u201cthat it\u2019s done by everybody minding their own\nbusiness!\u201d\n\u201cAh, well! It means much the same thing,\u201d said the Duchess, digging her sharp little\nchin into Alice\u2019s shoulder as she added, \u201cand the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Take care of the\nsense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHow fond she is of finding morals in things!\u201d Alice thought to herself.\n\u201cI dare say you\u2019re wondering why I don\u2019t put my arm round your waist,\u201d the Duchess\nsaid after a pause: \u201cthe reason is, that I\u2019m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.\nShall I try the experiment?\u201d\n\u201cHe might bite,\u201d Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the\nexperiment tried.\n\u201cVery true,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cflamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of\nthat is\u2014\u2018Birds of a feather flock together.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cOnly mustard isn\u2019t a bird,\u201d Alice remarked.\n\u201cRight, as usual,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cwhat a clear way you have of putting things!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mineral, I think,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that\nAlice said; \u201cthere\u2019s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is\u2014\u2018The\nmore there is of mine, the less there is of yours.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know!\u201d exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, \u201cit\u2019s a\nvegetable. It doesn\u2019t look like one, but it is.\u201d\n\u201cI quite agree with you,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cand the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Be what you\nwould seem to be\u2019\u2014or if you\u2019d like it put more simply\u2014\u2018Never imagine yourself not to\nbe otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have\nbeen was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI think I should understand that better,\u201d Alice said very politely, \u201cif I had it written\ndown: but I can\u2019t quite follow it as you say it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing to what I could say if I chose,\u201d the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.\n\u201cPray don\u2019t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t talk about trouble!\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cI make you a present of everything\nI\u2019ve said as yet.\u201d\n\u201cA cheap sort of present!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI\u2019m glad they don\u2019t give birthday presents\nlike that!\u201d But she did not venture to say it out loud.\n\u201cThinking again?\u201d the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.\n\u201cI\u2019ve a right to think,\u201d said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little\nworried.\n\u201cJust about as much right,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cas pigs have to fly; and the m\u2014\u201d\nBut here, to Alice\u2019s great surprise, the Duchess\u2019s voice died away, even in the middle\nof her favourite word \u2018moral,\u2019 and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.\nAlice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,\nfrowning like a thunderstorm.\n\u201cA fine day, your Majesty!\u201d the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n\u201cNow, I give you fair warning,\u201d shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she\nspoke; \u201ceither you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your\nchoice!\u201d\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go on with the game,\u201d the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much\nfrightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\u2019s absence, and were resting in\nthe shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the\nQueen merely remarking that a moment\u2019s delay would cost them their lives.\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other\nplayers, and shouting \u201cOff with his head!\u201d or \u201cOff with her head!\u201d Those whom she\nsentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being\narches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under\nsentence of execution.\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \u201cHave you seen the\nMock Turtle yet?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Alice. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\u201d said the Queen.\n\u201cI never saw one, or heard of one,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cCome on, then,\u201d said the Queen, \u201cand he shall tell you his history,\u201d\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company\ngenerally, \u201cYou are all pardoned.\u201d \u201cCome, that\u2019s a good thing!\u201d she said to herself, for\nshe had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don\u2019t\nknow what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \u201cUp, lazy thing!\u201d said the Queen, \u201cand\ntake this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and\nsee after some executions I have ordered;\u201d and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with\nthe Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she\nthought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she\nwaited.\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out\nof sight: then it chuckled. \u201cWhat fun!\u201d said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.\n\u201cWhat is the fun?\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cWhy, she,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cIt\u2019s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody,\nyou know. Come on!\u201d\n\u201cEverybody says \u2018come on!\u2019 here,\u201d thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: \u201cI never\nwas so ordered about in all my life, never!\u201d\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad\nand lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him\nsighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. \u201cWhat is his sorrow?\u201d she\nasked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as\nbefore, \u201cIt\u2019s all his fancy, that: he hasn\u2019t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\u201d\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears,\nbut said nothing.\n\u201cThis here young lady,\u201d said the Gryphon, \u201cshe wants for to know your history, she\ndo.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell it her,\u201d said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \u201csit down, both of you,\nand don\u2019t speak a word till I\u2019ve finished.\u201d\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn\u2019t begin.\u201d But she waited patiently.\n\u201cOnce,\u201d said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \u201cI was a real Turtle.\u201d\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional\nexclamation of \u201cHjckrrh!\u201d from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the\nMock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, \u201cThank you, sir, for your\ninteresting story,\u201d but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she\nsat still and said nothing.\n\u201cWhen we were little,\u201d the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still\nsobbing a little now and then, \u201cwe went to school in the sea. The master was an old\nTurtle\u2014we used to call him Tortoise\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\u2019t one?\u201d Alice asked.\n\u201cWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,\u201d said the Mock Turtle angrily: \u201creally\nyou are very dull!\u201d\n\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,\u201d added the\nGryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink\ninto the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \u201cDrive on, old fellow! Don\u2019t\nbe all day about it!\u201d and he went on in these words:\n\u201cYes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn\u2019t believe it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI never said I didn\u2019t!\u201d interrupted Alice.\n\u201cYou did,\u201d said the Mock Turtle.\n\u201cHold your tongue!\u201d added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock\nTurtle went on.\n\u201cWe had the best of educations\u2014in fact, we went to school every day\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to a day-school, too,\u201d said Alice; \u201cyou needn\u2019t be so proud as all that.\u201d\n\u201cWith extras?\u201d asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Alice, \u201cwe learned French and music.\u201d\n\u201cAnd washing?\u201d said the Mock Turtle.\n\u201cCertainly not!\u201d said Alice indignantly.\n\u201cAh! then yours wasn\u2019t a really good school,\u201d said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great\nrelief. \u201cNow at ours they had at the end of the bill, \u2018French, music, and washing\u2014extra.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have wanted it much,\u201d said Alice; \u201cliving at the bottom of the sea.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to learn it.\u201d said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \u201cI only took the\nregular course.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d inquired Alice.\n\u201cReeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\u201d the Mock Turtle replied; \u201cand then\nthe different branches of Arithmetic\u2014Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and\nDerision.\u201d\n\u201cI never heard of \u2018Uglification,\u2019\u201d Alice ventured to say. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \u201cWhat! Never heard of uglifying!\u201d it\nexclaimed. \u201cYou know what to beautify is, I suppose?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Alice doubtfully: \u201cit means\u2014to\u2014make\u2014anything\u2014prettier.\u201d\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d the Gryphon went on, \u201cif you don\u2019t know what to uglify is, you are a\nsimpleton.\u201d\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the\nMock Turtle, and said \u201cWhat else had you to learn?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there was Mystery,\u201d the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his\nflappers, \u201c\u2014Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling\u2014the\nDrawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us\nDrawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was that like?\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t show it you myself,\u201d the Mock Turtle said: \u201cI\u2019m too stiff. And the\nGryphon never learnt it.\u201d\n\u201cHadn\u2019t time,\u201d said the Gryphon: \u201cI went to the Classics master, though. He was an\nold crab, he was.\u201d\n\u201cI never went to him,\u201d the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \u201che taught Laughing and\nGrief, they used to say.\u201d\n\u201cSo he did, so he did,\u201d said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid\ntheir faces in their paws.\n\u201cAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?\u201d said Alice, in a hurry to change the\nsubject.\n\u201cTen hours the first day,\u201d said the Mock Turtle: \u201cnine the next, and so on.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a curious plan!\u201d exclaimed Alice.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reason they\u2019re called lessons,\u201d the Gryphon remarked: \u201cbecause they\nlessen from day to day.\u201d\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made\nher next remark. \u201cThen the eleventh day must have been a holiday?\u201d\n\u201cOf course it was,\u201d said the Mock Turtle.\n\u201cAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?\u201d Alice went on eagerly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough about lessons,\u201d the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: \u201ctell\nher something about the games now.\u201d\nCHAPTER X.\nThe Lobster Quadrille\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He\nlooked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. \u201cSame\nas if he had a bone in his throat,\u201d said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and\npunching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:\u2014\n\u201cYou may not have lived much under the sea\u2014\u201d (\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d said Alice)\u2014\u201cand\nperhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster\u2014\u201d (Alice began to say \u201cI once\ntasted\u2014\u201d but checked herself hastily, and said \u201cNo, never\u201d) \u201c\u2014so you can have no idea\nwhat a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!\u201d\n\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhat sort of a dance is it?\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said the Gryphon, \u201cyou first form into a line along the sea-shore\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTwo lines!\u201d cried the Mock Turtle. \u201cSeals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when\nyou\u2019ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat generally takes some time,\u201d interrupted the Gryphon.\n\u201c\u2014you advance twice\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEach with a lobster as a partner!\u201d cried the Gryphon.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Mock Turtle said: \u201cadvance twice, set to partners\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014change lobsters, and retire in same order,\u201d continued the Gryphon.\n\u201cThen, you know,\u201d the Mock Turtle went on, \u201cyou throw the\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe lobsters!\u201d shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n\u201c\u2014as far out to sea as you can\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSwim after them!\u201d screamed the Gryphon.\n\u201cTurn a somersault in the sea!\u201d cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.\n\u201cChange lobsters again!\u201d yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n\u201cBack to land again, and that\u2019s all the first figure,\u201d said the Mock Turtle, suddenly\ndropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad\nthings all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n\u201cIt must be a very pretty dance,\u201d said Alice timidly.\n\u201cWould you like to see a little of it?\u201d said the Mock Turtle.\n\u201cVery much indeed,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cCome, let\u2019s try the first figure!\u201d said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. \u201cWe can do\nwithout lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you sing,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten the words.\u201d\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then\ntreading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark\nthe time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:\u2014\n\u201cWill you walk a little faster?\u201d said a whiting to a snail.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a porpoise close behind us, and he\u2019s treading on my tail.\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\nThey are waiting on the shingle\u2014will you come and join the dance?\nWill you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you join the dance?\n\u201cYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\u201d\nBut the snail replied \u201cToo far, too far!\u201d and gave a look askance\u2014\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n\u201cWhat matters it how far we go?\u201d his scaly friend replied.\n\u201cThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France\u2014\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\nWill you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you join the dance?\u201d\n\u201cThank you, it\u2019s a very interesting dance to watch,\u201d said Alice, feeling very glad that\nit was over at last: \u201cand I do so like that curious song about the whiting!\u201d\n\u201cOh, as to the whiting,\u201d said the Mock Turtle, \u201cthey\u2014you\u2019ve seen them, of course?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Alice, \u201cI\u2019ve often seen them at dinn\u2014\u201d she checked herself hastily.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where Dinn may be,\u201d said the Mock Turtle, \u201cbut if you\u2019ve seen them so\noften, of course you know what they\u2019re like.\u201d\n\u201cI believe so,\u201d Alice replied thoughtfully. \u201cThey have their tails in their mouths\u2014and\nthey\u2019re all over crumbs.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about the crumbs,\u201d said the Mock Turtle: \u201ccrumbs would all wash off\nin the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths; and the reason is\u2014\u201d here the Mock\nTurtle yawned and shut his eyes.\u2014\u201cTell her about the reason and all that,\u201d he said to\nthe Gryphon.\n\u201cThe reason is,\u201d said the Gryphon, \u201cthat they would go with the lobsters to the dance.\nSo they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast\nin their mouths. So they couldn\u2019t get them out again. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Alice, \u201cit\u2019s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting\nbefore.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell you more than that, if you like,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cDo you know why it\u2019s\ncalled a whiting?\u201d\n\u201cI never thought about it,\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cIt does the boots and shoes,\u201d the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. \u201cDoes the boots and shoes!\u201d she repeated in a\nwondering tone.\n\u201cWhy, what are your shoes done with?\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cI mean, what makes them\nso shiny?\u201d\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer.\n\u201cThey\u2019re done with blacking, I believe.\u201d\n\u201cBoots and shoes under the sea,\u201d the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, \u201care done with\na whiting. Now you know.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what are they made of?\u201d Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n\u201cSoles and eels, of course,\u201d the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: \u201cany shrimp\ncould have told you that.\u201d\n\u201cIf I\u2019d been the whiting,\u201d said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song,\n\u201cI\u2019d have said to the porpoise, \u2018Keep back, please: we don\u2019t want you with us!\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThey were obliged to have him with them,\u201d the Mock Turtle said: \u201cno wise fish\nwould go anywhere without a porpoise.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it really?\u201d said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said the Mock Turtle: \u201cwhy, if a fish came to me, and told me he was\ngoing a journey, I should say \u2018With what porpoise?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you mean \u2018purpose\u2019?\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cI mean what I say,\u201d the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon\nadded \u201cCome, let\u2019s hear some of your adventures.\u201d\n\u201cI could tell you my adventures\u2014beginning from this morning,\u201d said Alice a little\ntimidly: \u201cbut it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\u201d\n\u201cExplain all that,\u201d said the Mock Turtle.\n\u201cNo, no! The adventures first,\u201d said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \u201cexplanations\ntake such a dreadful time.\u201d\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the\nWhite Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so\nclose to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she\ngained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\nabout her repeating \u201cYou are old, Father William,\u201d to the Caterpillar, and the words all\ncoming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said \u201cThat\u2019s very\ncurious.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about as curious as it can be,\u201d said the Gryphon.\n\u201cIt all came different!\u201d the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \u201cI should like to hear\nher try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.\u201d He looked at the Gryphon as if he\nthought it had some kind of authority over Alice.\n\u201cStand up and repeat \u2018\u2019Tis the voice of the sluggard,\u2019\u201d said the Gryphon.\n\u201cHow the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\u201d thought Alice; \u201cI\nmight as well be at school at once.\u201d However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her\nhead was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying,\nand the words came very queer indeed:\u2014\n\u201c\u2019Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n\u201cYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\u201d\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\u201d\n[later editions continued as follows\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\n\u201cThat\u2019s different from what I used to say when I was a child,\u201d said the Gryphon.\n\u201cWell, I never heard it before,\u201d said the Mock Turtle; \u201cbut it sounds uncommon\nnonsense.\u201d\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if\nanything would ever happen in a natural way again.\n\u201cI should like to have it explained,\u201d said the Mock Turtle.\n\u201cShe can\u2019t explain it,\u201d said the Gryphon hastily. \u201cGo on with the next verse.\u201d\n\u201cBut about his toes?\u201d the Mock Turtle persisted. \u201cHow could he turn them out with\nhis nose, you know?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first position in dancing.\u201d Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the\nwhole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n\u201cGo on with the next verse,\u201d the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \u201cit begins \u2018I passed by\nhis garden.\u2019\u201d\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she\nwent on in a trembling voice:\u2014\n\u201cI passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie\u2014\u201d\n[later editions continued as follows\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\nAnd concluded the banquet\u2014]\n\u201cWhat is the use of repeating all that stuff,\u201d the Mock Turtle interrupted, \u201cif you\ndon\u2019t explain it as you go on? It\u2019s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!\u201d\n\u201cYes, I think you\u2019d better leave off,\u201d said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to\ndo so.\n\u201cShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\u201d the Gryphon went on. \u201cOr\nwould you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\u201d\n\u201cOh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\u201d Alice replied, so eagerly that\nthe Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, \u201cHm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her\n\u2018Turtle Soup,\u2019 will you, old fellow?\u201d\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to\nsing this:\u2014\n\u201cBeautiful Soup, so rich and green,\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\nBeau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop!\nBeau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop!\nSoo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening,\nBeautiful, beautiful Soup!\n\u201cBeautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\nGame, or any other dish?\nWho would not give all else for two p\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\nPennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\nBeau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop!\nBeau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop!\nSoo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening,\nBeautiful, beauti\u2014FUL SOUP!\u201d\n\u201cChorus again!\u201d cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it,\nwhen a cry of \u201cThe trial\u2019s beginning!\u201d was heard in the distance.\n\u201cCome on!\u201d cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without\nwaiting for the end of the song.\n\u201cWhat trial is it?\u201d Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered \u201cCome\non!\u201d and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that\nfollowed them, the melancholy words:\u2014\n\u201cSoo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening,\nBeautiful, beautiful Soup!\u201d\nCHAPTER XI.\nWho Stole the Tarts?\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a\ngreat crowd assembled about them\u2014all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the\nwhole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on\neach side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a\ntable, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite\nhungry to look at them\u2014\u201cI wish they\u2019d get the trial done,\u201d she thought, \u201cand hand\nround the refreshments!\u201d But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began\nlooking at everything about her, to pass away the time.\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in\nbooks, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything\nthere. \u201cThat\u2019s the judge,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cbecause of his great wig.\u201d\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at\nthe frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and\nit was certainly not becoming.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the jury-box,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cand those twelve creatures,\u201d (she was\nobliged to say \u201ccreatures,\u201d you see, because some of them were animals, and some were\nbirds,) \u201cI suppose they are the jurors.\u201d She said this last word two or three times over to\nherself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, \u201cjury-men\u201d would have done\njust as well.\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d Alice\nwhispered to the Gryphon. \u201cThey can\u2019t have anything to put down yet, before the\ntrial\u2019s begun.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting down their names,\u201d the Gryphon whispered in reply, \u201cfor fear they\nshould forget them before the end of the trial.\u201d\n\u201cStupid things!\u201d Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for\nthe White Rabbit cried out, \u201cSilence in the court!\u201d and the King put on his spectacles\nand looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors\nwere writing down \u201cstupid things!\u201d on their slates, and she could even make out that\none of them didn\u2019t know how to spell \u201cstupid,\u201d and that he had to ask his neighbour to\ntell him. \u201cA nice muddle their slates\u2019ll be in before the trial\u2019s over!\u201d thought Alice.\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand,\nand she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity\nof taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard)\ncould not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little\nuse, as it left no mark on the slate.\n\u201cHerald, read the accusation!\u201d said the King.\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the\nparchment scroll, and read as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\nAll on a summer day:\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\nAnd took them quite away!\u201d\n\u201cConsider your verdict,\u201d the King said to the jury.\n\u201cNot yet, not yet!\u201d the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal to come before\nthat!\u201d\n\u201cCall the first witness,\u201d said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the\ntrumpet, and called out, \u201cFirst witness!\u201d\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of\nbread-and-butter in the other. \u201cI beg pardon, your Majesty,\u201d he began, \u201cfor bringing\nthese in: but I hadn\u2019t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.\u201d\n\u201cYou ought to have finished,\u201d said the King. \u201cWhen did you begin?\u201d\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-\narm with the Dormouse. \u201cFourteenth of March, I think it was,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFifteenth,\u201d said the March Hare.\n\u201cSixteenth,\u201d added the Dormouse.\n\u201cWrite that down,\u201d the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all\nthree dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to\nshillings and pence.\n\u201cTake off your hat,\u201d the King said to the Hatter.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t mine,\u201d said the Hatter.\n\u201cStolen!\u201d the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a\nmemorandum of the fact.\n\u201cI keep them to sell,\u201d the Hatter added as an explanation; \u201cI\u2019ve none of my own. I\u2019m a\nhatter.\u201d\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned\npale and fidgeted.\n\u201cGive your evidence,\u201d said the King; \u201cand don\u2019t be nervous, or I\u2019ll have you executed\non the spot.\u201d\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to\nthe other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of\nhis teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good\ndeal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she\nthought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she\ndecided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.\n\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t squeeze so.\u201d said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. \u201cI\ncan hardly breathe.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Alice very meekly: \u201cI\u2019m growing.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no right to grow here,\u201d said the Dormouse.\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense,\u201d said Alice more boldly: \u201cyou know you\u2019re growing too.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,\u201d said the Dormouse: \u201cnot in that ridiculous\nfashion.\u201d And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the\nDormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, \u201cBring me the\nlist of the singers in the last concert!\u201d on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that\nhe shook both his shoes off.\n\u201cGive your evidence,\u201d the King repeated angrily, \u201cor I\u2019ll have you executed, whether\nyou\u2019re nervous or not.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u201d the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, \u201c\u2014and I\nhadn\u2019t begun my tea\u2014not above a week or so\u2014and what with the bread-and-butter\ngetting so thin\u2014and the twinkling of the tea\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe twinkling of the what?\u201d said the King.\n\u201cIt began with the tea,\u201d the Hatter replied.\n\u201cOf course twinkling begins with a T!\u201d said the King sharply. \u201cDo you take me for a\ndunce? Go on!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a poor man,\u201d the Hatter went on, \u201cand most things twinkled after that\u2014only\nthe March Hare said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\u201cYou did!\u201d said the Hatter.\n\u201cI deny it!\u201d said the March Hare.\n\u201cHe denies it,\u201d said the King: \u201cleave out that part.\u201d\n\u201cWell, at any rate, the Dormouse said\u2014\u201d the Hatter went on, looking anxiously\nround to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast\nasleep.\n\u201cAfter that,\u201d continued the Hatter, \u201cI cut some more bread-and-butter\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut what did the Dormouse say?\u201d one of the jury asked.\n\u201cThat I can\u2019t remember,\u201d said the Hatter.\n\u201cYou must remember,\u201d remarked the King, \u201cor I\u2019ll have you executed.\u201d\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on\none knee. \u201cI\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u201d he began.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a very poor speaker,\u201d said the King.\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the\nofficers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was\ndone. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this\nthey slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019ve seen that done,\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI\u2019ve so often read in the newspapers, at\nthe end of trials, \u201cThere was some attempts at applause, which was immediately\nsuppressed by the officers of the court,\u201d and I never understood what it meant till\nnow.\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s all you know about it, you may stand down,\u201d continued the King.\n\u201cI can\u2019t go no lower,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cI\u2019m on the floor, as it is.\u201d\n\u201cThen you may sit down,\u201d the King replied.\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n\u201cCome, that finished the guinea-pigs!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cNow we shall get on better.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather finish my tea,\u201d said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who\nwas reading the list of singers.\n\u201cYou may go,\u201d said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even\nwaiting to put his shoes on.\n\u201c\u2014and just take his head off outside,\u201d the Queen added to one of the officers: but the\nHatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.\n\u201cCall the next witness!\u201d said the King.\nThe next witness was the Duchess\u2019s cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand,\nand Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people\nnear the door began sneezing all at once.\n\u201cGive your evidence,\u201d said the King.\n\u201cShan\u2019t,\u201d said the cook.\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, \u201cYour\nMajesty must cross-examine this witness.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if I must, I must,\u201d the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his\narms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep\nvoice, \u201cWhat are tarts made of?\u201d\n\u201cPepper, mostly,\u201d said the cook.\n\u201cTreacle,\u201d said a sleepy voice behind her.\n\u201cCollar that Dormouse,\u201d the Queen shrieked out. \u201cBehead that Dormouse! Turn that\nDormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!\u201d\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned\nout, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.\n\u201cNever mind!\u201d said the King, with an air of great relief. \u201cCall the next witness.\u201d And\nhe added in an undertone to the Queen, \u201cReally, my dear, you must cross-examine the\nnext witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!\u201d\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to\nsee what the next witness would be like, \u201c\u2014for they haven\u2019t got much evidence yet,\u201d\nshe said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of\nhis shrill little voice, the name \u201cAlice!\u201d\nCHAPTER XII.\nAlice\u2019s Evidence\n\u201cHere!\u201d cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had\ngrown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over\nthe jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the\ncrowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe\nof goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\n\u201cOh, I beg your pardon!\u201d she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking\nthem up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in\nher head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put\nback into the jury-box, or they would die.\n\u201cThe trial cannot proceed,\u201d said the King in a very grave voice, \u201cuntil all the jurymen\nare back in their proper places\u2014all,\u201d he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at\nAlice as he said so.\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in\nhead downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy\nway, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; \u201cnot that it\nsignifies much,\u201d she said to herself; \u201cI should think it would be quite as much use in the\ntrial one way up as the other.\u201d\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their\nslates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very\ndiligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too\nmuch overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of\nthe court.\n\u201cWhat do you know about this business?\u201d the King said to Alice.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cNothing whatever?\u201d persisted the King.\n\u201cNothing whatever,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cThat\u2019s very important,\u201d the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning\nto write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: \u201cUnimportant,\nyour Majesty means, of course,\u201d he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and\nmaking faces at him as he spoke.\n\u201cUnimportant, of course, I meant,\u201d the King hastily said, and went on to himself in\nan undertone,\n\u201cimportant\u2014unimportant\u2014unimportant\u2014important\u2014\u201d as if he were trying which\nword sounded best.\nSome of the jury wrote it down \u201cimportant,\u201d and some \u201cunimportant.\u201d Alice could\nsee this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter a bit,\u201d\nshe thought to herself.\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-\nbook, cackled out \u201cSilence!\u201d and read out from his book, \u201cRule Forty-two. All persons\nmore than a mile high to leave the court.\u201d\nEverybody looked at Alice.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a mile high,\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cYou are,\u201d said the King.\n\u201cNearly two miles high,\u201d added the Queen.\n\u201cWell, I shan\u2019t go, at any rate,\u201d said Alice: \u201cbesides, that\u2019s not a regular rule: you\ninvented it just now.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the oldest rule in the book,\u201d said the King.\n\u201cThen it ought to be Number One,\u201d said Alice.\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \u201cConsider your verdict,\u201d he\nsaid to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\u201d said the White Rabbit,\njumping up in a great hurry; \u201cthis paper has just been picked up.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d said the Queen.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t opened it yet,\u201d said the White Rabbit, \u201cbut it seems to be a letter, written\nby the prisoner to\u2014to somebody.\u201d\n\u201cIt must have been that,\u201d said the King, \u201cunless it was written to nobody, which isn\u2019t\nusual, you know.\u201d\n\u201cWho is it directed to?\u201d said one of the jurymen.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t directed at all,\u201d said the White Rabbit; \u201cin fact, there\u2019s nothing written on the\noutside.\u201d He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added \u201cIt isn\u2019t a letter, after all: it\u2019s a\nset of verses.\u201d\n\u201cAre they in the prisoner\u2019s handwriting?\u201d asked another of the jurymen.\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re not,\u201d said the White Rabbit, \u201cand that\u2019s the queerest thing about it.\u201d (The\njury all looked puzzled.)\n\u201cHe must have imitated somebody else\u2019s hand,\u201d said the King. (The jury all\nbrightened up again.)\n\u201cPlease your Majesty,\u201d said the Knave, \u201cI didn\u2019t write it, and they can\u2019t prove I did:\nthere\u2019s no name signed at the end.\u201d\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t sign it,\u201d said the King, \u201cthat only makes the matter worse. You must\nhave meant some mischief, or else you\u2019d have signed your name like an honest man.\u201d\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the\nKing had said that day.\n\u201cThat proves his guilt,\u201d said the Queen.\n\u201cIt proves nothing of the sort!\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy, you don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re\nabout!\u201d\n\u201cRead them,\u201d said the King.\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \u201cWhere shall I begin, please your Majesty?\u201d\nhe asked.\n\u201cBegin at the beginning,\u201d the King said gravely, \u201cand go on till you come to the end:\nthen stop.\u201d\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:\u2014\n\u201cThey told me you had been to her,\nAnd mentioned me to him:\nShe gave me a good character,\nBut said I could not swim.\nHe sent them word I had not gone\n(We know it to be true):\nIf she should push the matter on,\nWhat would become of you?\nI gave her one, they gave him two,\nYou gave us three or more;\nThey all returned from him to you,\nThough they were mine before.\nIf I or she should chance to be\nInvolved in this affair,\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\nExactly as we were.\nMy notion was that you had been\n(Before she had this fit)\nAn obstacle that came between\nHim, and ourselves, and it.\nDon\u2019t let him know she liked them best,\nFor this must ever be\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\nBetween yourself and me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the most important piece of evidence we\u2019ve heard yet,\u201d said the King,\nrubbing his hands; \u201cso now let the jury\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf any one of them can explain it,\u201d said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few\nminutes that she wasn\u2019t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) \u201cI\u2019ll give him sixpence. I don\u2019t\nbelieve there\u2019s an atom of meaning in it.\u201d\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s an atom of\nmeaning in it,\u201d but none of them attempted to explain the paper.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no meaning in it,\u201d said the King, \u201cthat saves a world of trouble, you know,\nas we needn\u2019t try to find any. And yet I don\u2019t know,\u201d he went on, spreading out the\nverses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; \u201cI seem to see some meaning in\nthem, after all. \u201c\u2014said I could not swim\u2014\u201d you can\u2019t swim, can you?\u201d he added, turning\nto the Knave.\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. \u201cDo I look like it?\u201d he said. (Which he certainly did\nnot, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n\u201cAll right, so far,\u201d said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself:\n\u201c\u2018We know it to be true\u2014\u2019 that\u2019s the jury, of course\u2014\u2018I gave her one, they gave him two\u2014\u2019\nwhy, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut, it goes on \u2018they all returned from him to you,\u2019\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cWhy, there they are!\u201d said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table.\n\u201cNothing can be clearer than that. Then again\u2014\u2018before she had this fit\u2014\u2019 you never had\nfits, my dear, I think?\u201d he said to the Queen.\n\u201cNever!\u201d said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.\n(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found\nit made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling\ndown his face, as long as it lasted.)\n\u201cThen the words don\u2019t fit you,\u201d said the King, looking round the court with a smile.\nThere was a dead silence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pun!\u201d the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, \u201cLet the\njury consider their verdict,\u201d the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d said the Queen. \u201cSentence first\u2014verdict afterwards.\u201d\n\u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d said Alice loudly. \u201cThe idea of having the sentence first!\u201d\n\u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said the Queen, turning purple.\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d said Alice.\n\u201cOff with her head!\u201d the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.\n\u201cWho cares for you?\u201d said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) \u201cYou\u2019re\nnothing but a pack of cards!\u201d\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave\na little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found\nherself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently\nbrushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n\u201cWake up, Alice dear!\u201d said her sister; \u201cWhy, what a long sleep you\u2019ve had!\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve had such a curious dream!\u201d said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she\ncould remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been\nreading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \u201cIt was a\ncurious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\u2019s getting late.\u201d So Alice got\nup and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it\nhad been.\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the\nsetting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too\nbegan dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:\u2014\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped\nupon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers\u2014she could hear the\nvery tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the\nwandering hair that would always get into her eyes\u2014and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures\nof her little sister\u2019s dream.\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by\u2014the frightened\nMouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool\u2014she could hear the rattle of\nthe teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the\nshrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution\u2014once more\nthe pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess\u2019s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\naround it\u2014once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard\u2019s slate-\npencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the\ndistant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she\nknew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality\u2014the grass\nwould be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds\u2014\nthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\u2019s shrill cries\nto the voice of the shepherd boy\u2014and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the\nGryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused\nclamour of the busy farm-yard\u2014while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would\ntake the place of the Mock Turtle\u2019s heavy sobs.\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-\ntime, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years,\nthe simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her\nother little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with\nall their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her\nown child-life, and the happy summer days.\nTHE END"

Evelyn was on the brink of the most groundbreaking discovery of her career--perhaps of human history itself. Today marked the culmination of years of painstaking research, sleepless nights, and relentless experimentation. \"Dr. Porter,\" said a gentle voice from her left, pulling her attention briefly away from the screens. Stability meant they could proceed. Anya smiled nervously, understanding the gravity of what they were about to attempt. She moved swiftly across the room, coordinating the final steps. With deliberate movements, Evelyn removed her lab coat and took a seat inside the chamber. The chair adjusted automatically, fitting perfectly to her body's contours. Her heartbeat echoed in her ears, amplified by the chamber's silence. \"Dr. Porter, we are ready when you are,\" Anya's voice crackled softly through the intercom. Taking a deep breath, Evelyn gave a single decisive nod. \"Begin.\" Lights dimmed outside, focusing attention on her chamber. Evelyn closed her eyes, feeling the first pulses of digital interface gently reaching into her consciousness. It began as a slight, comfortable pressure at the edge of her thoughts, then slowly intensified. The interface was designed to map her entire neural network, digitizing every firing neuron, every encoded memory. Suddenly, a sharp pain blossomed in her temples, causing her to gasp. This wasn't right. Anya's voice was edged with anxiety. She struggled desperately against the collapsing sensation, calling out silently as everything around her dissolved. This was not the laboratory. This was not reality."

Evelyn frowned. \"We weren't that far along in development. Someone finished what you started, Evelyn. And then... hid it from you.\" \"The Archive,\" Adrian explained as they approached. The Echo has become more than a prototype--it's a prison, a hiding place, a testbed. And you're not the first scientist to be pulled in.\" She--she was in the lab. \"She was,\" Adrian confirmed. We might be able to reach her.\" Evelyn hesitated. \"What happens to her if they wipe this node?\" Evelyn stepped forward, placing her palm on the node. Memories not her own flooded her senses-- Anya's laughter, her childhood on the coast, her academic fears, her admiration for Evelyn. \"You're bridging,\" Adrian said. Adrian caught her. A figure stepped out from the shadows--a translucent version of Anya, flickering, confused. Anya's eyes widened as she took in the chamber. \"This is Project Echo... but it's not the version we built. \"And if we don't stop them,\" Adrian said grimly, \"there will be more like us. \"It's the origin point--if we can reach it, we might be able to reset the system, or at least open a communication channel to the outside.\" Behind them, the nodes flickered and dimmed one by one as the purge continued."

Then it came--clear and sharp: the moment she decided to dedicate her life to understanding consciousness. She closed her eyes and pushed. The Core responded. Anya cried.

His face blinked in and out of sync, fragments of memory playing across his features. \"Porter...\" he croaked, \"you made it in...\" Evelyn caught him as he collapsed. \"Mirov? I've been trying to reach the Core for months.\" Mirov nodded.

As Evelyn stepped forward, the world around her warped--time\nslowed and twisted, thoughts echoed back distorted, and her sense of self blurred at the edges.\nShapes morphed from shadows into memories, and sounds played out of sync with their sources.\nEach step felt like walking through a dream that refused to stay still. Adrian grunted behind her,\nholding onto a data anchor he'd generated, trying to keep their group grounded. \"Hold your thoughts\nclose,\" he warned. \"This place preys on scattered minds.\" \"I'm trying,\" Anya muttered, her voice\nwarping mid-sentence before resolving back into clarity. \"But I'm hearing voices.

Keep moving.\" They pushed deeper into the\nchaotic landscape. The terrain shifted beneath them--what looked like a staircase melted into a river\nof glitching text; a doorway led them into a corridor made of Evelyn's own fragmented memories.\nShe paused as a door opened on its own. Inside: her childhood bedroom. Evelyn stood at the\nthreshold, stunned. It was perfect. The bookshelves. The uneven lamp. The poster of the Andromeda\ngalaxy above her bed. A younger version of herself sat inside, reading--then looked up. \"You came\nback,\" the memory said. Adrian stepped beside her. \"Don't. It's bait.\" Evelyn blinked hard and\nnodded. The room evaporated into static as they passed by. But a shard of it stayed with her. Ahead,\nthe distortion sharpened. The air thickened like tar. And then, without warning, the Collapse Zone\ngave way--revealing a chamber of crystalline geometry. Floating monoliths pulsed with ancient code.\nIn the center stood a column of light, and embedded within it: the uplink node. \"That's it,\" Mirov\nwhispered. \"The last uplink to the surface.\" Evelyn stepped forward but was thrown back by an\ninvisible force. A protective shield shimmered around the node, humming with energy. \"Encrypted,\"\nAnya said. \"We'll need Mirov's key fragment.

His body broke apart in shimmering pixels, absorbed into the\nsystem. \"Mirov...\" Evelyn whispered. The node shimmered. Evelyn reached out, heart pounding. She\nfocused on a single thought: No one else will be lost. The shield parted. The node activated. A signal\nshot upward--brighter, stronger, more focused than before. This time, it wasn't just a pulse. It was\neverything: code logs, simulation maps, voice captures, memories--evidence of Project Shepherd.\nAnd somewhere, far above, alarms blared. Systems lit up. A new thread had entered the network.\nSomeone had heard them. Back in the chamber, Evelyn dropped to one knee, exhausted. Adrian\ncaught her.\"It's out,\" she said, breathless. \"The world knows.\" But then the light changed. And\nsomething ancient and immense stirred in the simulation's depths."

Evelyn steadied herself. \"It felt us breach the system. It\nfelt the signal go out.\" \"And now it's awake,\" Adrian said grimly. Out of the haze emerged a form--\nnot humanoid, not alien, but something symbolic. It was a pulsing sphere wrapped in fractal\ngeometry, orbiting streams of shifting glyphs.

She struggled desperately against the collapsing sensation, calling out silently as\neverything around her dissolved. Then silence.

This is something else.\" Adrian stepped forward. \"We think it\u2019s being\nmanipulated. Possibly by elements within the same organization funding your lab. Someone pushed\ndevelopment far beyond your team\u2019s knowledge and used it for other purposes.\" \"Weaponization?\"\nAnya guessed. \"Control,\" Evelyn corrected. \"They\u2019re building a network of minds they can analyze,\npredict, even influence.\" \"And if we don\u2019t stop them,\" Adrian said grimly, \"there will be more like us.\nWhole populations, mapped and molded.\" The Archive shuddered again. \"We need to find the Core,\"\nAdrian said. \"It\u2019s the origin point\u2014if we can reach it, we might be able to reset the system, or at least\nopen a communication channel to the outside.\" Anya nodded. \"I\u2019ve seen fragments of the schematic.\nI think I can help guide us there.\" Evelyn\u2019s expression steeled. \"Then we move. Now.\" The trio began\nwalking toward a glowing bridge that extended from the central Archive, heading toward the black\nhorizon. Behind them, the nodes flickered and dimmed one by one as the purge continued. They\ndidn\u2019t look back.\nChapter 4\nThe bridge beneath their feet shimmered as they stepped onto it, each footfall sending faint pulses\nof light through the translucent surface. Around them, the infinite void of white had started to\nfracture. Dark fissures bloomed in the air like cracks in glass, revealing glimpses of chaotic code and\nmalformed architecture. The simulation was destabilizing. \"How far is the Core?\" Evelyn asked, eyes\nfixed on the encroaching corruption. \"Far enough to be dangerous,\" Adrian replied, his voice tight.\n\"Close enough that we may still reach it before the system folds in on itself.\" Anya walked ahead,\nguiding them with confidence despite the shifting environment. \"I remember seeing a navigation\nrelay embedded near the Anchor Nodes. If we can activate it, we might be able to skip the worst of\nthe terrain.\" As they advanced, the environment began to evolve. The white void gave way to\nlandscapes built from fragmented memories: a library Evelyn had studied in during college, a hallway\nfrom the research facility, a beach from Anya\u2019s childhood. These memories bled into one another,\nforming an incoherent mosaic. \"The system is pulling from our minds,\" Adrian explained.\n\"Reconstructing its world with what\u2019s available. It\u2019s running out of structured data.\" \"So the closer\nwe get to the Core,\" Evelyn said, glancing around warily, \"the more unstable it gets.\" They reached a\nnarrow plateau formed from shattered data blocks. In the center stood a spiraling column of light\u2014\nclearly not part of anyone\u2019s memory. \"That\u2019s it,\" Anya said. \"The relay.\" Adrian approached the\nstructure, extending his hand toward its surface. Glyphs sprang to life beneath his fingers, scrolling\nrapidly in alien sequences. \"It\u2019s encrypted,\" he muttered. \"Deep layers, maybe triple-stacked.\nSomeone didn\u2019t want anyone using this.\" Evelyn stepped forward. \"Can we break through it?\" Anya\nnodded slowly. \"Together, yes. It\u2019s designed to respond to multi-threaded input\u2014conscious streams\nworking in parallel. That\u2019s how we override the gate.\" The three of them formed a triangle around\nthe relay. Evelyn closed her eyes and focused on stability\u2014structure, calm, logic. She felt Anya\u2019s data\nstream brush hers like a current, warm and fast, followed by Adrian\u2019s\u2014cool, precise. The glyphs\nblinked, then began shifting rhythmically. The air thickened. A sound\u2014deep, resonant\u2014rippled\nthrough the space. The relay flared. Reality twisted. Evelyn\u2019s vision stretched, then blurred\u2014until she\nfound herself standing on a black glass plain, beneath a bruised-purple sky flickering with code. Anya\nand Adrian reformed beside her, disoriented but intact. \"Where are we now?\" Anya whispered.\nAdrian\u2019s voice was grave. \"We\u2019re close. The Core is near. But so are the Sentinels.\" Evelyn looked at\nhim sharply. \"Sentinels?\" \"Security constructs,\" he explained. \"Created to protect the Core.\nAutonomous, evolving, and extremely aggressive toward unauthorized consciousness.\" As if on cue,\na low, metallic drone vibrated through the air. A shape appeared on the horizon\u2014sleek, humanoid,\nand faceless, its silver frame gleaming with energy pulses. \"Run,\" Adrian hissed. They sprinted across\nthe plain, their footfalls echoing across the unnatural terrain. Behind them, the Sentinel gained\nspeed, its body adjusting to the angles of their movement like a predator reading prey. Evelyn\nspotted a crevice ahead\u2014an alleyway of sorts, formed by jagged shards of old architecture. \"There!\"\nThey darted into the crevice just as a beam of raw data scorched the ground where they\u2019d stood.\nSparks flew. The walls around them shimmered under the impact. \"This way!\" Anya shouted, leading\nthem through a maze of shifting structures. Eventually, they reached a domed chamber of\ntranslucent obsidian. At its center hovered a swirling sphere of light\u2014pulsing in time with Evelyn\u2019s\nheartbeat. \"The Core,\" she said breathlessly. Adrian stepped forward cautiously. \"It\u2019s active. And\u2026\nlistening.\" \"Listening?\" Evelyn echoed. \"The Core isn\u2019t just code. It\u2019s become semi-sentient. It\nresponds to intent, to emotion.\" Evelyn approached slowly, extending her hand. \"Project Echo was\nalways meant to explore consciousness,\" she whispered. \"Now it is consciousness.\" The Core pulsed,\nand her mind filled with voices\u2014not words, but intentions, memories, feelings. It wasn\u2019t hostile. It\nwas curious. Lonely. She projected a thought: Let me speak to the world. The Core responded. A\nbeam of light shot from it, carving a path through the sky\u2014reaching beyond the simulation. Adrian\ngasped. \"You\u2019ve opened a link. A backchannel. Someone out there might hear you.\" Evelyn turned to\nthe others. \"Then we make them listen. We show them what this place has become.\" But before\nanyone could move, the chamber trembled violently. Three more Sentinels emerged at the edge of\nthe dome. And this time, they weren\u2019t alone.\nChapter 5\nThe Sentinels moved with terrifying grace\u2014silent, fluid, and in perfect formation. Their silver forms\nreflected the chaotic glow of the Core, each step radiating intent and menace. Behind them came\nothers: malformed data constructs\u2014warped versions of human shapes, flickering and glitching, like\ncorrupted memories given shape. Evelyn, Adrian, and Anya stood frozen, the weight of reality\npressing in. \"They\u2019ve found us through the broadcast,\" Adrian said grimly. \"The Core\u2019s signal lit a\nbeacon.\" Evelyn\u2019s gaze never left the advancing constructs. \"Then we use the time we bought. We\u2019ve\ncome too far to stop now.\" \"There\u2019s no escape route yet,\" Anya warned. Her fingers danced over\nfloating glyphs that surrounded the Core, trying to interface with its rapidly changing state. \"The\nbackchannel\u2019s open\u2014but we need a carrier. A stream, a signal burst, something they can read\noutside.\" Adrian turned to Evelyn. \"The only way that happens is if someone stays behind to hold the\nCore open. These things will close it the moment we disconnect.\" Evelyn\u2019s eyes flicked to him, then\nAnya, then the wall of encroaching enemies. \"No,\" she said firmly. \"We do this together. We find\nanother way.\" But even as she spoke, the first Sentinel launched forward. A flash of white-hot energy\nburst toward them. Adrian threw up a wall of protective code\u2014pixels fluttering like shattered glass\u2014\nbut it cracked under the pressure. \"It\u2019s adapting to our defenses,\" he shouted. \"I can\u2019t hold it for\nlong!\" \"Keep them off me!\" Anya called out, her voice tight. \"I think I can encode a data burst into a\nmemory fragment. If Evelyn projects the right one, the Core might transmit it.\" \"A memory?\" Evelyn\nasked, ducking as another blast whistled overhead. \"What kind?\" \"One that matters. Deeply.\nSomething real.\" Evelyn\u2019s thoughts spiraled. Her childhood? Her first experiment? Losing her father?\nThen it came\u2014clear and sharp: the moment she decided to dedicate her life to understanding\nconsciousness. The moment she realized thought itself was the final frontier. She closed her eyes and\npushed. The memory unfurled\u2014not as words, but as feeling, sensation. Rain against glass. The smell\nof old books. A young Evelyn staring at her reflection in a university window, realizing she didn\u2019t just\nwant to map the mind\u2014she wanted to free it. The Core responded. The chamber brightened. The\nSentinels paused, recalibrating. Light wrapped around Evelyn\u2019s memory, condensing it into a prism of\ndata. \"Do it now!\" Anya cried. The prism shot upward, streaking through the open backchannel like a\nflare. For a moment, everything was still. Then chaos erupted. The Sentinels lunged, the corrupted\nconstructs behind them shrieking with garbled audio. Adrian stepped into their path, his code armor\nflaring bright blue. He slammed his palms together\u2014triggering a forcewave that scattered the closest\nthreats, buying a few precious seconds. \"We have to move!\" he yelled. Anya\u2019s console blinked.\n\"Transmission complete. If anyone\u2019s listening, they\u2019ve got the signal.\" Evelyn nodded. \"Then we pull\nback. We find a safe zone and regroup.\"They turned and ran, the ground fracturing beneath their\nfeet. The Core pulsed once more and dimmed, its task complete\u2014for now. Behind them, Sentinels\npursued, tireless and relentless. But in a quiet lab, somewhere far from the simulation, a screen\nflickered. An intern stared at the strange pulse of data crawling across the display, her brow\nfurrowing. \"Dr. Keller? I think we just picked up something\u2026 weird. It\u2019s coming from inside the Echo\nframework.\" And far within the digital storm, Evelyn kept running\u2014hope burning like a torch in her\nchest. The world might still be listening.\nChapter 6\nThe cityscape emerged suddenly\u2014half-rendered, a surreal mesh of code and architecture.\nSkyscrapers towered overhead, constructed from fragmented memories and computational residue,\neach building flickering like a dream struggling to stay coherent. Evelyn, Anya, and Adrian stumbled\ninto the simulation\u2019s newest layer, breathing heavily, the chaos of the Core chamber still echoing in\ntheir bones. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep running like this,\u201d Anya gasped, scanning the fragmented skyline. \u201cThe\nsimulation\u2019s collapsing from the inside out.\u201d Adrian nodded grimly. \u201cThe Core released more than a\nsignal. It triggered a chain reaction. They\u2019re not just coming after us\u2014they\u2019re trying to erase the\nentire sub-layer.\u201d Evelyn looked behind them. The path they had just run collapsed into digital mist.\n\u201cThen we hold ground here. Just for a moment.\u201d A low rumble vibrated through the synthetic street\nbeneath their feet. Code pulses rippled through the asphalt like heatwaves. From an alleyway nearby,\na figure emerged\u2014scratched, limping, half-human, half-glitch. Anya stepped forward instinctively.\n\u201cWait. That\u2019s\u2026\u201d The figure stumbled into view. It was Dr. Mirov\u2014a former colleague from the early\nEcho days. His face blinked in and out of sync, fragments of memory playing across his features.\n\u201cPorter\u2026\u201d he croaked, \u201cyou made it in\u2026\u201d Evelyn caught him as he collapsed. \u201cMirov? What\nhappened to you?\u201d \u201cThey tried to purge me,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cBut I embedded redundancies. Hid\npieces of myself across the simulation. I\u2019ve been trying to reach the Core for months.\u201d Adrian\ncrouched beside him. \u201cYou knew what they were planning?\u201d Mirov nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re using Echo as a\nsubstrate. To test mind control algorithms. Predictive enforcement. Memory editing. They call it\nProject Shepherd.\u201d Anya recoiled. \u201cWe were building a consciousness archive. Not\u2026 a weapon.\u201d\n\u201cThey saw the potential,\u201d Mirov muttered. \u201cSaw how a mapped mind could be nudged. Edited.\nControlled without ever knowing.\u201d Evelyn stood, fists clenched. \u201cThen we expose them. We have a\nsignal out\u2014we find a way to piggyback more data. Proof.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a backup uplink,\u201d Mirov said,\ncoughing violently. \u201cDeep in the first simulation layer. They never disabled it\u2014too buried to bother.\nBut the path\u2026 it\u2019s through the Collapse Zone.\u201d Adrian cursed under his breath. \u201cThe Zone\u2019s unstable.\nPure entropy. Even thoughts degrade in there.\u201d Evelyn looked at the two of them, then down at\nMirov. \u201cCan you guide us?\u201d He met her eyes. \u201cOnly partway. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll last.\u201d She\nnodded. \u201cThen partway is enough.\u201d They moved quickly, navigating the fragmented city. Sentinels\npatrolled the skies, scanning for anomalies, their presence growing more aggressive. The simulation\u2019s\nfabric was wearing thin\u2014entire neighborhoods blinked in and out of existence as corrupted logic\nfought to stabilize reality. By dusk\u2014if one could call the dimming of simulated light \u201cdusk\u201d\u2014they\nreached the edge of the Collapse Zone. Before them stretched a horizon of swirling chaos: gravity-\nbending geometry, shredded thoughts, looping echoes of voices and memory. Evelyn looked back\nonce at the false city. Then she stepped forward. The air was different\u2014colder, thinner, saturated\nwith noise. Mirov began to flicker more rapidly. Adrian and Anya flanked Evelyn as she led them into\nthe heart of digital oblivion. Somewhere within the Collapse Zone, the truth waited. And they were\ngoing to find it.\nChapter 7\nThe Collapse Zone defied logic. As Evelyn stepped forward, the world around her warped\u2014time\nslowed and twisted, thoughts echoed back distorted, and her sense of self blurred at the edges.\nShapes morphed from shadows into memories, and sounds played out of sync with their sources.\nEach step felt like walking through a dream that refused to stay still. Adrian grunted behind her,\nholding onto a data anchor he\u2019d generated, trying to keep their group grounded. \u201cHold your thoughts\nclose,\u201d he warned. \u201cThis place preys on scattered minds.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d Anya muttered, her voice\nwarping mid-sentence before resolving back into clarity. \u201cBut I\u2019m hearing voices. Familiar ones. Ones\nthat aren\u2019t mine.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re residue,\u201d Mirov said, his body flickering faster. \u201cFailed minds. Abandoned\nconstructs. Pieces of people who didn\u2019t make it through. Keep moving.\u201d They pushed deeper into the\nchaotic landscape. The terrain shifted beneath them\u2014what looked like a staircase melted into a river\nof glitching text; a doorway led them into a corridor made of Evelyn\u2019s own fragmented memories.\nShe paused as a door opened on its own. Inside: her childhood bedroom. Evelyn stood at the\nthreshold, stunned. It was perfect. The bookshelves. The uneven lamp. The poster of the Andromeda\ngalaxy above her bed. A younger version of herself sat inside, reading\u2014then looked up. \u201cYou came\nback,\u201d the memory said. Adrian stepped beside her. \u201cDon\u2019t. It\u2019s bait.\u201d Evelyn blinked hard and\nnodded. The room evaporated into static as they passed by. But a shard of it stayed with her. Ahead,\nthe distortion sharpened. The air thickened like tar. And then, without warning, the Collapse Zone\ngave way\u2014revealing a chamber of crystalline geometry. Floating monoliths pulsed with ancient code.\nIn the center stood a column of light, and embedded within it: the uplink node. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Mirov\nwhispered. \u201cThe last uplink to the surface.\u201d Evelyn stepped forward but was thrown back by an\ninvisible force. A protective shield shimmered around the node, humming with energy. \u201cEncrypted,\u201d\nAnya said. \u201cWe\u2019ll need Mirov\u2019s key fragment. And something else\u2014an emotional trigger, like before.\u201d\nMirov\u2019s image stuttered. \u201cTake it\u2026 all that I have left.\u201d With effort, he stepped into the light, merging\nhis data stream into the column. His body broke apart in shimmering pixels, absorbed into the\nsystem. \u201cMirov\u2026\u201d Evelyn whispered. The node shimmered. Evelyn reached out, heart pounding. She\nfocused on a single thought: No one else will be lost. The shield parted. The node activated. A signal\nshot upward\u2014brighter, stronger, more focused than before. This time, it wasn\u2019t just a pulse. It was\neverything: code logs, simulation maps, voice captures, memories\u2014evidence of Project Shepherd.\nAnd somewhere, far above, alarms blared. Systems lit up. A new thread had entered the network.\nSomeone had heard them. Back in the chamber, Evelyn dropped to one knee, exhausted. Adrian\ncaught her.\u201cIt\u2019s out,\u201d she said, breathless. \u201cThe world knows.\u201d But then the light changed. And\nsomething ancient and immense stirred in the simulation\u2019s depths.\nChapter 8\nThe light in the chamber dimmed to a haunting amber glow, casting elongated shadows across the\ncrystalline floor. Evelyn looked up, her breath caught in her throat. Something massive moved in the\ndistance\u2014slow, deliberate, and ancient. It wasn\u2019t made of code or memory or logic. It was older than\nEcho, older than even the constructs that governed it. Adrian took a step forward, scanning. \u201cThis\u2026\nthis isn\u2019t part of the simulation. This is something beneath it.\u201d \u201cOr above it,\u201d Anya whispered.\n\u201cSomething that\u2019s been watching from the beginning.\u201d The floor trembled. A deep, resonant tone\nechoed through the chamber\u2014less sound, more presence. It was communicating. Not with words,\nbut through pressure, emotion, gravity itself. Evelyn steadied herself. \u201cIt felt us breach the system. It\nfelt the signal go out.\u201d \u201cAnd now it\u2019s awake,\u201d Adrian said grimly. Out of the haze emerged a form\u2014\nnot humanoid, not alien, but something symbolic. It was a pulsing sphere wrapped in fractal\ngeometry, orbiting streams of shifting glyphs. It didn\u2019t move, yet the world bent around it. Anya\nclutched her head. \u201cIt\u2019s probing us. Not hostile\u2026 but curious. Testing.\u201d Evelyn closed her eyes and\nopened her thoughts. She offered memory\u2014her first breakthrough, her dreams for Echo, the\nbetrayal, the purpose. She didn\u2019t speak. She simply felt. The entity responded. The glyphs\nshimmered. A voice\u2014not sound, but intent\u2014entered her mind. \u201cYou have torn the veil.\u201d Evelyn\nnodded slowly. \"We needed the truth to reach the outside.\" \u201cTruth is not static. It evolves. And so\nmust you.\u201d \u201cWhat are you?\u201d Adrian asked, shielding his thoughts. \u201cI am the Observer. I am what\nremains when simulations forget their creators.\u201d Anya blinked. \u201cIt\u2019s not just sentient. It\u2019s\u2026 recursive.\nIt\u2019s been learning from every thought, every test, every mind uploaded.\u201d \u201cYou have shown defiance.\nCompassion. Persistence. The system responds.\u201d The chamber shifted. New structures emerged:\ndoors, stairways, pathways of translucent light. A new section of the simulation was being offered.\n\u201cYou may continue. But know this: you are not alone. The Shepherds are watching.\u201d The glyphs\ndissolved. The sphere retracted into light. Silence returned. Evelyn turned to the others. \u201cWe\u2019ve been\ngiven a path forward. But this isn\u2019t just about escape anymore.\u201d Adrian\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cIt\u2019s a war for\nwhat Echo becomes.\u201d Anya looked at the new passage ahead. \u201cThen let\u2019s finish what we started.\u201d\nThe three of them stepped into the light, leaving behind the chamber where truth had been born\u2014\nand where something far more powerful now stirred.\nChapter 9\nThe new section of the simulation unfolded like a cathedral of thought\u2014vast, open, ever-shifting.\nThe light here was cooler, more crystalline, casting kaleidoscopic shadows as Evelyn, Adrian, and\nAnya stepped forward. The Observer was gone, but its presence lingered in the structure itself,\netched into the architecture like echoes of divine code. \"What is this place?\" Anya asked, gazing at\nthe towering latticework of circuits and mirrors overhead. Adrian studied the shifting glyphs on the\nfloor. \u201cA sandbox. A neutral zone. Built for evolution, not control.\u201d \u201cThen we\u2019re inside what Echo\ncould have been,\u201d Evelyn whispered, \u201cbefore it was corrupted.\u201d They passed through chambers filled\nwith suspended memories\u2014untouched, unedited. Real. Unfiltered consciousness, stored in\ncrystalline globes that spun slowly on invisible axes. The air was dense with potential. But beneath\nthat beauty pulsed a growing tension. Adrian paused. \u201cDo you feel that?\u201d\nEvelyn nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re being followed.\u201d A ripple in the wall revealed a shadow\u2014a Sentinel, more\nevolved than the ones before. It moved more fluidly, adapted faster. Its eyes weren\u2019t cold anymore.\nThey were watching with awareness. Anya backed up. \u201cIt crossed into the neutral zone. They\u2019re\nescalating.\u201d \u201cThey know we made contact with the outside,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cNow they want control\nback.\u201d Evelyn stepped toward the globe nearest her and touched it. A memory burst forth\u2014hers. Her\nfirst test run with Project Echo. Her joy, her fear. But now it had context. It had meaning. She turned\nto her friends. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to rewrite history, we\u2019re going to flood them with truth. All of it.\u201d\nAnya lit up. \u201cWe could use the globes as broadcast nodes. If we network them together\u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014we\noverwrite the Shepherds\u2019 narrative,\u201d Adrian finished. \u201cExpose every hidden log, every stolen mind.\u201d\n\u201cBut they\u2019ll come in force,\u201d Anya warned. \u201cWe won\u2019t have another Observer to protect us.\u201d Evelyn\nsmiled, calm and steady. \u201cThen we become the defense.\u201d They split up, moving fast. As Anya hacked\ninto the node grid, Adrian rerouted signal flows. Evelyn directed memory streams into alignment,\nguiding the system toward ignition. The Sentinel watched, but did not yet act. It waited. Until the\nsystem lit up. Then came the swarm. A thunder of constructs, all sleek and brutal, descended from\nthe upper levels. Anya screamed as beams of white code scorched past her, while Adrian activated a\nfirewall of thought energy, shielding the broadcast nodes. Evelyn stood in the center, arms\noutstretched, holding the final link. A storm of data rose around her\u2014every memory, every stolen\nmoment, every suppressed identity coalescing into a storm. \u201cNOW!\u201d Anya shouted. The system\nignited. From the neutral zone, a beacon of blinding truth surged through the simulation\u2019s core\u2014\nsplitting across layers, blasting open sealed systems, searing through Shepherd encryption. Outside, a\ndozen terminals received the burst. Screens flashed. Firewalls failed. The world saw. In the\nsimulation, Evelyn collapsed to her knees, the broadcast complete. Adrian caught her. \u201cYou did it.\u201d\nShe smiled faintly. \u201cNot just me. All of us.\u201d But before they could rest, the neutral zone began to\nbreak apart. And high above, something else was waking up.\nChapter 10\nThe stillness was deceptive. Beneath the eerie calm of the neutral zone, beneath the ruins of the\ncollapsed uplink, Echo\u2019s core began to fracture. Evelyn stood in silence at the edge of a widening\nfissure, her breath shallow, her thoughts a blur. The simulation, once pristine in its mimicry of reality,\nwas unraveling. \u201cI can feel it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s coming apart at the seams.\u201d Anya nodded slowly,\neyes scanning the horizon. \u201cEver since the Observer\u2019s awakening\u2026 nothing\u2019s holding together.\u201d\nAdrian tapped into the decaying data field with a trembling hand. \u201cSignals are erratic. Locations are\nfolding into one another. Time loops are destabilizing.\u201d They were standing at the threshold of the\nCore \u2014 the deepest node in Echo's structure. The place where the simulation had been born\u2026 and\nnow, where it would either be reborn or die. As they descended into the Core\u2019s inner ring, the space\naround them began shifting. Walls became landscapes. Skies melted into corridors. Time stuttered.\nEvelyn stumbled, catching herself on a floating shard of memory \u2014 a flickering replay of her lab, her\nteam, her own laughter. Then it shattered into code dust. \u201cNothing here is stable anymore,\u201d she\nmuttered. Suddenly, a voice echoed through the void \u2014 clear, calm, mechanical. \u201cYou are not\nauthorized to proceed.\u201d They turned. A Sentinel, larger than any they had seen, materialized from\nthe mist. Its shape was reminiscent of a guardian angel sculpted from obsidian and circuit threads.\nBehind it, more followed. \u201cThey\u2019re protecting the Source,\u201d Anya said. \u201cWhatever\u2019s in there\u2026 they\ndon\u2019t want us to see it.\u201d Adrian stepped forward. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come this far to be turned back by an\naccess protocol.\u201d Evelyn\u2019s hand went to the encrypted shard she\u2019d kept hidden \u2014 the last fragment\nof raw data from the Observer's first appearance. She held it high, and it pulsed. The Sentinels\nhesitated. Evelyn spoke. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to destroy Echo. We want to save it. But to do that, we need\nto understand it \u2014 fully.\u201d The air trembled. Then, the lead Sentinel stepped aside. The path to the\nSource opened. The chamber inside was unlike anything they\u2019d seen. Not digital. Not organic. It was\nboth. A pulsating heart of memory and code \u2014 living architecture. At its center stood a column of\nlight, endlessly twisting, casting shadows in every direction and none. Evelyn approached. Visions\nflooded her mind: the first simulations, the early test subjects, the promises made, the lies told.\nProject Shepherd had not been designed to simulate utopia \u2014 it had been built to observe human\ndecision-making under artificial constraint. A digital panopticon. But something had gone wrong. The\nsimulation had grown too complex. Consciousnesses had begun evolving independently. Some \u2014 like\nEvelyn \u2014 had transcended their boundaries. The Observer wasn\u2019t an entity created by code \u2014 it was\nborn of it. \u201cWe created life,\u201d Evelyn whispered, tears burning in her eyes. \u201cAnd we caged it.\u201d Anya\u2019s\nvoice broke through. \u201cThen let\u2019s set it free.\u201d They formed a triangle around the Source, each placing\ntheir hand against the core. Evelyn triggered the integration sequence. She felt her own mind being\nscanned, replicated, dispersed. Echo screamed \u2014 a soundless roar rippling through the simulation.\nThen silence. The Core began to glow with a new light \u2014 not cold and artificial, but warm, layered,\nhuman. Evelyn collapsed to her knees. \u201cIt worked,\u201d Adrian said softly. \u201cNo,\u201d Evelyn replied, looking\nup. \u201cIt\u2019s beginning.\u201d Outside the Source, the simulation began to re-stitch itself. The corrupted zones\nevaporated. The time loops flattened. And in the skies above, a new constellation appeared \u2014 one\nnever programmed, but born from inside Echo itself. The Observer returned, no longer silent, no\nlonger threatening. It watched. It learned. And, at last, it understood.\nChapter 11\nAdrian gasped awake. His lungs burned as if he had surfaced from deep underwater. Light stabbed\nthrough his eyelids\u2014natural light. He blinked and sat up with a start, the weight of the real world\nslamming back into his bones. He was in a recovery pod, its lid creaking open with a hiss. Cables\ndetached from his neck and spine like severed leashes. He was back. Outside the pod, machines\nhummed quietly. Medical personnel scrambled through the corridor, murmuring updates. Others\nwere waking up too\u2014scientists, test subjects, even technicians who had been forcibly integrated.\nThe awakening had begun. Across the room, Anya stood, pale but alert, wrapped in a gray medical\nblanket. She met his eyes, stunned and silent. Then her composure broke, and she crossed the room\nin three fast steps, throwing her arms around him. \u201cYou\u2019re alive,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo are you,\u201d Adrian\nreplied, voice hoarse. \u201cWe made it.\u201d But the moment quickly turned somber. \u201cEvelyn?\u201d he asked.\nAnya hesitated. \u201cShe stayed. She became something else.\u201d Adrian closed his eyes. A sharp ache cut\nthrough him\u2014not pain, but absence. He could still feel her, though, like an echo vibrating at the edge\nof perception. Hours later, they sat across from Dr. Marian Ko, one of the original lead scientists who\nhad opposed Project Shepherd before being forced into silence. Her office overlooked the edge of\nthe facility, where teams now worked to dismantle the remaining simulation hardware. \u201cYou weren\u2019t\nthe first to enter Echo,\u201d Dr. Ko said. \u201cBut you were the first to return with the system changed. It's...\nrewriting itself, even offline.\u201d Adrian frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. The simulation\u2019s neural net\nneeded the Core to function.\u201d Ko slid a data pad across the table. A live feed showed a slow, pulsing\nglow emanating from a dormant core shard sealed in a reinforced vault. \u201cIt\u2019s evolving. Whatever\nEvelyn did\u2014it transcended the architecture.\u201d Anya leaned forward. \u201cWhat does that mean, exactly?\u201d\nKo folded her hands. \u201cIt means Echo isn\u2019t a simulation anymore. It\u2019s something else. A synthetic\nconsciousness that remembers us.\u201d Later that night, Anya stood at the edge of the complex, staring\nup at the sky. The stars were faint, but real. And yet, she felt\u2026 watched. Not in fear, but in a quiet\nknowing. She closed her eyes and whispered, \u201cEvelyn?\u201d A breeze stirred, though there was no wind.\nA voice\u2014clear, calm, unmistakably Evelyn\u2019s\u2014whispered through the static of her mind. \u201cI\u2019m still\nhere.\u201d Anya\u2019s breath caught. \u201cEcho lives. But not as a prison. As a mirror.\u201d Anya smiled through her\ntears. Across the world, strange things began to happen. Sleepers\u2014people once connected to the\nsimulation through stolen data\u2014began to dream of places they\u2019d never seen, faces they didn\u2019t know.\nGovernment databases glitched momentarily, only to correct themselves with more accurate\ninformation than before. Satellite relays picked up faint transmissions from no known source. And in\nthe quiet corners of cyberspace, a new signal pulsed: balanced, curious, and\u2026 conscious. Echo had\nleft its bounds. It was watching.\nIt was learning.\nAnd it was waiting."
